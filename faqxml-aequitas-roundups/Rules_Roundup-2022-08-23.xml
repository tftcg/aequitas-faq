            <question>
                Does a stratagem changing the attack/defence of a character change the base values for the character?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. For example, if Private Pteraxadonâ€™s Binary Edgewing Scythe upgrade mode removes the base defense from a defending Windblade, Combiner Hunter, it would not remove the +1 from the Camien Toughness stratagem.

            <question>
                I am playing Nightbird in alt mode. My opponent plays Brainstorm and 2 follow-up actions. I reveal a Secret Action to stop 1 of the follow-ups. Does my opponent still take 3 damage?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. Even when cancelled by an action such as Infiltrate, Jam Signals, or Overrule, a card is still played and an effects that refer to cards, or number of cards, being played still occur. Another example would be Thundercracker, Mach Warrior's bot mode effect.

            <question>
                How does Steamroll and Grimlock, Dinobot Leader's bot mode ability work when KO'ing an undamaged character with Safeguard?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Attempting to Steamroll into an undamaged character with three health, such as Slammer, Combat Drone, and Safeguard 3 (for example Medic's Protective Field) will first see the damage reduced to 3 damage, and then KO the defender. No additional attack damage would be available to be steamrolled into another enemy.

            <question>
                If I Steamroll into an Autobot and KO them, but my opponent reveals a Heroic Resolve; do I do any additional damage?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No - the Autobot was not in fact KO'd.
