      <question>Dinobot Enigma says "5 Dinobots in bot mode", can I use Wave 1 Dinobots to form Volcanicus?</question>
      <answer>No. The Wave 2 Combiner Dinobots must be used. This was covered in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TransformersTCG/videos/volcanicus-and-not/473222143208266/">video</a>. </answer>

          <!-- This is based on a Facebook screenshot shared on Discord of a question WotC answered -->
          <question>
              If a character has more than one Cargo Trailer, how much additional attack does it have?
          </question>
          <answer>
              <ul><li>One cargo trailer &#x2192; +1 attack</li><li>Two cargo trailers &#x2192; +4 attack</li><li>Three cargo trailers &#x2192; +9 attack</li></ul>
              Each cargo trailer checks for how many cargo trailers are on the bot. So, with three cargo trailers equipped,
              the first one checks, sees that three cargo trailers are on the bot, and adds three attack. Then the second one 
              checks and adds an additional three attack and so on.

          <question>
              With respect to Perceptor's alt mode ability, is zero a pile?
          </question>
          <answer>
              Yes, zero is a pile. It is perfectly fine to split the cards into two piles, one of four cards and one of zero. Listen to this <a href="https://youtu.be/VMqWDWBo2ro?t=1822">designer interview</a> for confirmation (30:26 into the interview).

          <question>
              If I play Peace Through Tyranny and my opponent has a Secret Action out, does that Secret Action scrap at the end of my current turn or does it stay out through my second turn?
          </question>
          <answer>
              It scraps at the end of your current turn and is not present for your second turn.

                Can you I Still Function a character with a Body mode?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <!-- Content in a WotC article I believe -->
                You can't bring back a Body mode character from KO because it won't have a head. Effects like I Still Function! and Involuntary Promotion will not work at all to bring back a Body. You can, however, bring back a Head from KO because it will be in Bot mode (and only in Bot mode).

            <question>
                 If your opponent KOs one of your characters, other than the Battleship, and you play an I Still Function! to bring that character back, does Tidal Wave combine at the end of turn?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes, Tidal Wave does combine. WotC (Drew) confirmed this in a comment to this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transformerstcg/permalink/2998793173489493/">community poll</a>.

                Why is there a Decepticon symbol on Gear's stratagem?
            </question>
            <answer>
                In the 1985 <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Changing_Gears">Changing Gears</a> episode of the G1 cartoon, Gears has a circuit removed and becomes a happy to please mechanoid who will help anyone, including the Decepticons. The symbol on the stratagem is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transformerstcg/permalink/2778809832154496/?comment_id=2778864748815671">stated</a> to be a tongue in cheek reference to that episode.

            <question>
                Can the Better Things To Do Than Die stratagem be used on Sergeant Springer?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. It is solely for Autobot Springer - Aerial Defense. The lack of "Autobot" in the stratagem target is believed to be unintended.

            <question>
                How does Vesatility interact with Toolbox? Would it effectively double the impact of Versatility, since each battle icon colour you flip is a separate instance, or does it just add 1 to the total being repaired?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Toolbox only adds 1 to the total being repaired. The 'for each' in Versatility is looping to calculate the amount of repair that will be done, then the repair is applied as one event. Raider Ratbat works the same way.
                Wave 1's Chop Shop however works the other way. It has the repair inside the for each, allowing Toolbox to apply for each repaired damage.
