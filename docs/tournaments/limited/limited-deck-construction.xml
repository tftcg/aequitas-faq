What are the rules for Limited deck construction?
          </question>
          <answer> 
Limited decks must contain a minimum of 25 battle cards. The maximum deck size is every card in the player’s card pool. Unlike Constructed decks, Limited decks may contain more than three of any battle card and more than one of any character card, as long as those cards are in the player’s card pool. A player’s character cards and deck may have a total of no more than 25 Stars.

What is the Card Pool?
          </question>
          <answer> 
The card pool consists of each character and battle card a player opens or drafts in a Limited tournament. Players participating in Limited tournaments may freely change the composition of their decks between matches (but not games) by exchanging cards from their deck for other cards in their card pool without being required to return their deck to its original composition before their next match. Players must ensure their deck has at least the minimum 25 battle cards after making any modifications.
