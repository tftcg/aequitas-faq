      <question>
Are Character cards with Voice Actor signatures on them (if you got your card signed, something I might want to do) legal for tournament play? If so, are there any specifics? (in another TCG, as long as the signature doesn't cover any of the text on the card; it's legal)
        </question>
      <answer>
Good question! For Character Cards, markings/signatures should not obscure critical card information like rules text or character stats. Otherwise, that should be fine. Ultimately, however, legality of an individual card is up to the Head Judge of the event in question.
