              What are the rules for Constructed deck construction?
          </question>
          <answer> 
Constructed decks must contain a minimum of 40 cards. There is no maximum deck size. A deck may contain no more than 3 of any individual card based on its English name. A player may not use more than one character card bearing the same complete card name (character name plus subname). A playerâ€™s character cards and deck may have a total of no more than 25 Stars.
A card may only be used in a particular format if the card is from a set that is legal in that format or has the same name as a card from a set that is legal in that format.
Cards banned in a specific format may not be used in decks for that format.
