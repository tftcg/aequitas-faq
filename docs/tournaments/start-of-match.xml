              How do we decide who goes first?
          </question>
          <answer>
For the first game of a match, the winner of a random method (such as a die roll or coin toss) chooses
either to play first or to play second.
After each game in a match, the loser of that game chooses to either play first or play second in the next
game. If the previous game was a draw, the player who chose at the beginning of the drawn game
chooses again.
