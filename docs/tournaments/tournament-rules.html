        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Deck checks may be performed at any tournament at the option of the head judge. A deck check compares the deck registration list to the current contents of a player’s deck. If they do not match, appropriate penalties may be issued.

        <div class="answer">
          Players are allowed to take written notes during a match and may refer to those notes while that match is in progress. At the beginning of a match, each player’s note sheet must be empty and must remain visible throughout the match. Players do not have to explain or reveal notes to other players. <a href="/custom-cards/bfa-world|strike/wave-1/keywords/judges.html">Judges</a> may ask to see a player’s notes and/or request that the player explain their notes.<br/>Players may not refer to other notes, including notes from previous matches, during games.<br/>Between games, players may refer to a brief set of notes made before the match. They are not required to reveal these notes to their opponents. These notes must be removed from the play area before the beginning of the next game. Players taking excessive amounts of time reviewing notes may be subject to Slow Play penalties.

          If I start with <a href="/custom-cards/alpha-trion-protocols/wave-2/characters/raider-overkill-spy-patrol-havoc-wreaker.html">Overkill</a> on my team, can I put an Overkill from outside the game into my KO area?

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No, this will be more covered in a Tournament Rules Doc. You may only ever have one of each named character on your battlefield or in the KO area. This concept is further emphasized by the word “different” among the many abilities in this same vein.
