             What are Bounty abilities?
        </question>
        <answer>
             There are two parts to a Bounty ability: a trigger condition that tells you to “use this card’s Bounty ability” and the Bounty ability itself that gives you a reward. In this set, all the conditions are the same: when the character does enough attack damage to KO an enemy. The rewards are different on each card.

        <question>
             If a character does more than enough attack damage to KO an enemy, does that count?
        </question>
        <answer>
             Yes. The character can do more attack damage than is necessary to KO the enemy and you’ll still get the reward.

      <question>
Do you need to have the character in Bot mode showing the Bounty for this card to use the bounty. Or does the card activate the character’s Bounty regardless of mode?
        </question>
      <answer>
Abilities are only active if that side is face-up. I.E. you must be in Bot Mode to use a Bot Mode ability.

      <question>
Revenge on Ratbat and Bounty on Deadlock both trigger upon Ratbat's KO, but which triggers first?
        </question>
      <answer>
Bounty abilities and Revenge abilities will usually trigger at the same time. Bounty abilities are usually handled first because they belong to the active player.
