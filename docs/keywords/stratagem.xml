            <question>
                How many stratagems can I play?
            </question>
            <answer>
                You can play up to one stratagem for each different character, trait, or faction listed on the stratagem, as long as your starting team includes that character, trait, or faction. For example, if your starting team is all Autobots and includes Optimus Prime - Legendary Warrior, you can play both Heroic Spotlight and Duty &amp; Honor.

                Where do I put my stratagems?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Stratagems go on the battlefield. At the beginning of the game, as you reveal your team, you also reveal your stratagems.

            <question>
                Some stratagems have an ability that causes them to flip. What does that mean?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Flipping a stratagem essentially turns its ability off. This happens on one-time abilities to remind you that you've already used them.

            <question>
                Does a stratagem count as a card in my deck of battle cards?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. Stratagems are never put into your deck.

            <question>
                Can I put stratagems in my sideboard?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. Each one counts as one of your ten battle cards in the sideboard.

            <question>
                Does a stratagem changing the attack/defence of a character change the base values for the character?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. For example, if Private Pteraxadonâ€™s Binary Edgewing Scythe upgrade mode removes the base defense from a defending Windblade, Combiner Hunter, it would not remove the +1 from the Camien Toughness stratagem.

            <question>
                When do you choose to add stratagems out of your sideboard? When declaring characters or when sideboarding battlecards?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Stratagems are played concurrently with the starting team for a game. This is required otherwise cards like Master Converter and Aerial Enhancements would not effect the starting team, leading Windsweeper to be sad when Blitzwing and Tracks don't count as Planes.
