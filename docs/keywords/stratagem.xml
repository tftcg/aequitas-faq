                How many stratagems can I play?
            </question>
            <answer>
                You can play up to one stratagem for each different character, trait, or faction listed on the stratagem, as long as your starting team includes that character, trait, or faction. For example, if your starting team is all Autobots and includes Optimus Prime - Legendary Warrior, you can play both Heroic Spotlight and Duty &amp; Honor.

                Where do I put my stratagems?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Stratagems go on the battlefield. At the beginning of the game, as you reveal your team, you also reveal your stratagems.

            <question>
                Some stratagems have an ability that causes them to flip. What does that mean?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Flipping a stratagem essentially turns its ability off. This happens on one-time abilities to remind you that you've already used them.

                Does a stratagem count as a card in my deck of battle cards?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. Stratagems are never put into your deck.
