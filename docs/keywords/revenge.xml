             What are Revenge abilities?
        </question>
        <answer>
             A Revenge ability is a triggered ability that triggers when the character with the ability is KO’d. There aren’t that many of them. They’re a Decepticon thing. The Decepticons must be up to something.

      <question>
Revenge on Ratbat and Bounty on Deadlock both trigger upon Ratbat's KO, but which triggers first?
        </question>
      <answer>
Bounty abilities and Revenge abilities will usually trigger at the same time. Bounty abilities are usually handled first because they belong to the active player.
