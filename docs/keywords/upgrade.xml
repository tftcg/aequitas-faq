        <question>
             Can I have more than one of the same Upgrade on the battlefield?
        </question>
        <answer>
             Yes. Upgrades aren’t unique. You could have two characters each with the same Weapon, for
example.

             Some Upgrades say "Put on [something] only." How does that work?
        </question>
        <answer>
             These abilities describe what kind of character the Upgrade can be put on. This is usually a trait such
as Melee, Plane, or Insecticon. An Upgrade can be put on a character only if that character matches the
listed requirement.

        <question>
             Let’s say I have an Upgrade that says "Put on Planes only" and I put it on a Plane. But then next turn I
flip the Plane to its other mode, and it’s no longer a Plane. What happens?
        </question>
        <answer>
             The Upgrade stays with the character it’s on. That ability limits only what the Upgrade can initially be
put on. Once that happens, the Upgrade doesn’t check again.
