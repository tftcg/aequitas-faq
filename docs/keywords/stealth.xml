             What is Stealth?
        </question>
      <answer>
             Stealth is a new keyword ability that lets some characters strike from the shadows without fear
of reprisal. When choosing which enemy to attack, you must attack a character without stealth
if able.

      <question>
             If my opponent has one tapped character with stealth, and the rest of their creatures are
untapped, which character can I attack?
        </question>
      <answer>
             Stealth doesn’t override the rules for attacking tapped/untapped characters. Since the
tapped character is the only one that can be attacked, that’s where your attack is headed.

             What happens if a character has brave and stealth?
        </question>
      <answer>
             Brave and stealth essentially cancel each other out. You must attack that character if able,
and you must attack other characters if able. This basically means you must attack a character
you can attack, the same as if those abilities weren’t there.

      <question>
Razorclaw’s robot mode ability says that when he flips to that mode he can attack untapped characters that turn as though they were tapped. If a character has Stealth when untapped, does Razorclaw treat them as tapped or untapped for the purpose of their Stealth?
        </question>
      <answer>
The character will still have Stealth. Razorclaw’s ability changes the way that Razorclaw can attack but doesn’t actually change the Tapped/Untapped state of other cards.

      <question>
If you have a Stealthiness attached to Headstrong in his Alternate Mode, what happens? Does Brave trump the Stealth or vice versa?
      </question>
      <answer>
The opponent can choose to attack any available target; they essentially cancel each other out.
