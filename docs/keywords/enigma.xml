      <question>
             If I use an Enigma to combine my characters into the Combiner, can I then use the card’s first
ability to get its effect?
        </question>
      <answer>
             No. You always follow the instructions on the card in order. If you don’t already have the specified Combiner on the battlefield, the first ability won’t do anything.
