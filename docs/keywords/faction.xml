             Some cards refer to Autobots or Decepticons. How do I know which characters are Autobots?
        </question>
        <answer>
             Autobots have a red frame and the Autobot insignia in the lower right corner. Decepticons have a purple frame and the Decepticon insignia in the lower right corner. A few characters have "Autobot" or "Decepticon" in their names, although these arenâ€™t the only Autobots and Decepticons.

            How does Soldier's Blaster (and similar cards) work when interacting with a character who is both an Autobot and a Decepticon? 
        </question>
        <answer>
            Different faction means "does not share a faction identity." For a character which is both an Autobot and a Decepticon, "not sharing a faction identity" means NOT Autobot and NOT Decepticon. Currently, this leaves Mercenary as the only different faction.
