          Hidden information refers to information a player isn’t allowed access to, such as the faces of cards in an opponent’s hand.<br/>Throughout the match and pregame procedures, players are responsible for keeping their cards above the level of the playing surface and for making reasonable efforts to prevent hidden information from being revealed.<br/>However, players may choose to reveal their hands or any other hidden information available only to them, unless specifically prohibited by the rules. Players must not actively attempt to gain information hidden from them.

          The rulebook says "When your turn ends, put all battle cards you flipped for attacks during that turn into your scrap pile. Also put any Actions you played that turn into your scrap pile." When do you scrap the cards the defender flipped for attacks?

          If you have no cards in your scrap pile and play a weapon to replace an already existing weapon on a character, does the replaced weapon immediately go to your scrap pile, or does it hit the scrap pile at the end of your turn?

          Can you scrap cards from your hand? This came up from playing a lot of the Turbo format with my kids. Inevitably someone had one or two cards that you couldn't play with the characters. If you're allowed to scrap them from your hand when drawn it would still allow those cards to be useful for the pips when battling.

          You cannot scrap cards from your hand for no reason or simply because you'd like to, but there are a plethora of effects in the game (such as green battle icons) that allow you to swap cards in and out of your hand.

          Can a card target something even if it won't have an effect? For example, can <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/unconventional-flying-object.html">Unconventional Flying Object</a> target a Body mode character?

          Cards try to do as much as they can. You can play <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/unconventional-flying-object.html">Unconventional Flying Object</a> even if you don't have a Spaceship and it will only accomplish putting the Action into your scrap. There are a handful of Upgrades like <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/crushing-treads.html">Crushing Treads</a> that are restricted to play on say "Put only on a Tank." – you can't play that card unless you have the specific kind of character to put it on. After you successfully put it on the right kind of character, the game won't check anymore if the upgrade is valid, so the character can flip to Bot mode, stop being a Tank, and the Upgrade will stay on.

          The Round Up two weeks ago mentioned that the loser of game 1 picks who goes first for game 2, and so on for game 3. However, the official and most recent FAQ that’s published says that the player who starts the game alternates. Which should we go by, officially, for the tiebreaker?

          It is my turn; my opponent is tapped out. I have one untapped Bot, I play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/inferno-breath.html">Inferno Breath</a> and tap my bot to deal 3 damage. It is now my turn to attack, but I have no bots to attack. I figure we will both untap, but who goes next? Do I attack as I have not attacked for my turn? Is it my opponent’s turn even, though I did not attack? Rules state you must attack each turn.

          Concerning “start of turn” effects timing around the drawing 1 card from the general card rules: which of the following is true:<br/>    You Draw 1 card from general game rules, then activate Start of Turn Effects (like Omnibots’ start of turn effects playing upgrades).<br/>    2. You activate Start of Turn Effects, then Draw 1 card from general game rules.<br/>    3.

          I have run into a situation where my deck had no cards and no discard pile to shuffle in. We ruled it as when I attacked or defended, I had no cards to flip so I added 0 to my attack and defense. We were wondering if this would be a proper ruling. Second, for the card Inverted. It says that for each orange pip you flip becomes a blue pip and vice versa. For cards that rely on you flipping a certain color pip, do the pips flipped count as what they are or the inverted color?

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          When you have no deck left, you just don’t flip any cards. Inverted’s effect applies immediately. For example, if an ability triggers whenever you flip two orange icons, and you flip two blue icons under Inverted (meaning the cards literally have blue icons printed on them), that ability will trigger.
