<faq><target name="Increased Durability"><entry id="64">
      <question>Let’s say the upgraded character normally has 10 health. It gets upgraded with Increased Durability, then gets 12 damage counters. If Increased Durability is scrapped, what happens?</question>
      <answer>Any time the game notices a character with a number of damage counters equal to or greater than its current health, the character is KO’d. So your character is KO’d. Sorry.</answer>
