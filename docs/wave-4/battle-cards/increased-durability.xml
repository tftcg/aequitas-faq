      <question>Let’s say the upgraded character normally has 10 health. It gets upgraded with Increased Durability, then gets 12 damage counters. If Increased Durability is scrapped, what happens?</question>
      <answer>Any time the game notices a character with a number of damage counters equal to or greater than its current health, the character is KO’d. So your character is KO’d. Sorry.</answer>

            <question>
                What happens if I Reprocess to Scrap an Increased Durability on a character with 3 health remaining?
            </question>
            <answer>
                The Increased Durability is scrapped and the character is then KO'd. As the character is now in the KO area, the repair does not happen.
