      <question>
If I reveal Stable Cover while Jazz is defending in Alt mode, does this protect his ability from being shut down even if the attacker has Pierce?

                Does Jazz's ability work with Stable Cover? Stable Cover implies that the enemy still has Pierce, they just can't use it, while Jazz states "an enemy that doesn't have Pierce".

            <answer>
                As stated, the enemy still has Pierce so Jazz's alt mode ability does not trigger.
