      <question>
With Showing Off, would a Bot receive any and all "when you flip to" triggers during the process or does it only count the final mode it's flipped to? For example, if Grimlock - Dinobot Leader is in bot mode and plays Showing Off, could he end in Bot mode with the Bold 3 from his Alt mode?
        </question>
      <answer>
Yes, you can first flip Grimlock to alt mode, causing the ability on that mode to trigger, and then flip back to bot mode.

          <tftcg-note>While the alt mode ability triggers when Grimlock is flipped to alt-mode, note that the trigger does not resolve until after Showing Off has completed and Grimlock is back in bot-mode. </tftcg-note>

      <question>
For Showing Off, can I flip Sergeant Springer to one alt mode and use its effect then flip to the other Alt mode and use its effect too? Or must I resolve Showing Off completely first?
        </question>
      <answer>
Showing Off resolves completely before any abilities that triggered happen.
