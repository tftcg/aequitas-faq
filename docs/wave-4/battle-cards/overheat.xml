      <question>If Overheat is revealed, do effects like Energized Field’s still work?</question>
      <answer>Yes. With Overheat, orange battle icons don’t add to the attack value, but they were still flipped, so any other effects that care about flipping orange battle icons will still work. The same is true for black battle icons.</answer>
