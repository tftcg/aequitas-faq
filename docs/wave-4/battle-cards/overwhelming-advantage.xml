      <question>
If I play Brainstorm into 2 Overwhelming Advantages and meet all the requirements, can I do 15 damage to 2 different enemies? Or must they target the same character?
        </question>
      <answer>
Each Overwhelming Advantage is separate, so they can do damage to different characters.
