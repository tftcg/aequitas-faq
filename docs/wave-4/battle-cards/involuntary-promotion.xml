      <question>What happens if the character I bring back from the KO area ends up with enough damage counters to KO it?</question>
      <answer>Both characters will end up KO’d, but the character that started in the KO area will be on the battlefield for a short time. For example, any ability that triggers when Upgrades are moved onto that character will still happen. If that character has any revenge abilities, those abilities will also happen.</answer>

      <question>
If I have a character with Bumpers attached, and I play Involuntary Promotion on a car in my KO area, does the returned character receive the Bumpers in time to prevent the damage counters from being moved?
        </question>
      <answer>
The damage and upgrades are moved at the same time. Bumpers’ effect won’t stop the damage counters from being moved.

      <question>
Can I KO a Battle Master with Involuntary Promotion if I have no bots in my KO area?
        </question>
      <answer>
Yes. If you have no characters in KO or the characters in your KO area have too many stars, you can use Involuntary Promotion to KO one of your characters.

      <question>
Regarding Involuntary Promotion trigger timings, when I shift the upgrade and damage counters to the returned character. Do I get to choose to shift the damage counters first followed by the upgrades since they are both my triggers?
        </question>
      <answer>
No part of Involuntary Promotion is a triggered ability. The instructions are all followed in order and the damage counters and upgrades are moved at the same time.

      <question>
Does Involuntary Promotion count as "repairing" the resurrected character? In other words, could Torox or Ratchet benefit from its play?
        </question>
      <answer>
No. The character appears on the Battlefield fully repaired. It’s not repaired while on the Battlefield.
