        <question>
            If Optimus - Legendary Warrior attacks in bot-mode with less characters than your opponent and you choose to repair a character upgraded with Toolbox, will you repair 4 because there are two times, or is it just 3 because it is one time repairing?
        </question>
        <answer>
            It's repair 1 "then" repair 1. So Toolbox will change it to repair 2, then repair 2, for a total of 4.
