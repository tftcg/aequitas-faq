      <question>Say my opponent has an ability that triggers when they play an Action. They play a blue action, but I reveal Jam Signals to scrap it with no effect. Does their other ability trigger?</question>
      <answer>Yes. Although the blue action itself will have no effect, your opponent still played an action, so the other ability will still work.</answer>
