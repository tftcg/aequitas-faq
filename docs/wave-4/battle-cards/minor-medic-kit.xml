      <question>Let’s say the upgraded character normally has 10 health. It gets upgraded with Minor Medic Kit, then gets 10 damage counters. If Minor Medic Kit is scrapped, what happens?</question>
      <answer>Any time the game notices a character with a number of damage counters equal to or greater than its current health, the character is KO’d. So your character is KO’d. Really sorry.</answer>
