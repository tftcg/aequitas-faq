      <question>Say a character with base attack 0 has Guarded Posture, and then I put a Primary Laser (a Weapon that gives it +2 attack) on it. What is the character’s attack?</question>
      <answer>It will have 1 attack. Although a character’s attack can’t go below 0, the -1 applies again once your character’s attack is raised.</answer>
