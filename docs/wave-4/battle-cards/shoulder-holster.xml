      <question>Say the upgraded character has 2 Weapons and Shoulder Holster is scrapped. What happens?</question>
      <answer>In most cases, this means the character won’t have enough Weapon slots to keep both Weapons. If it’s your character, you choose which one the character keeps. The other one is scrapped.</answer>
