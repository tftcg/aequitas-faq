      <question>Are the cards revealed when they’re put into the KO area?</question>
      <answer>Yes. They will be face up in the KO area. Either player can look at them. (Don’t grab your opponent’s cards without permission though.)</answer>

      <question>If my opponent has Secret Actions in their hand, scrap pile, or even in their KO area (say because of Daring Escape), do those count?</question>
