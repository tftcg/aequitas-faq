      <question>Can I choose a character that doesn’t have a Bounty ability just to get the attack bonus?</question>
      <answer>Yes. The last ability won’t do anything, but you’ll still get the +2 attack.</answer>

      <question>
If Nightbird attacks with a Contract Contingency and it triggers Nightbird’s bounty, can I take another Contract Contingency from my opponent’s scrap pile, play this, then trigger Nightbird’s bounty again?
Or can you only trigger Contract Contingency once because you are not getting 4 or more attack damage through after applying the plus 2 to the already finished attack?
        </question>
      <answer>
The second Contract Contingency won’t trigger because it will be played after the attack damage has been done.
