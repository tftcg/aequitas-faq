      <question>Can this ability trigger more than once in the same turn?</question>
      <answer>Yes. If youâ€™re showing off and have some way to flip the upgraded character multiple times in the same turn, the ability will add Bold 2 each time.</answer>

        <question>
            What happens if I get the trigger, but my opponent reveals a Sabotaged Armaments?
        </question>
        <answer>
            The Trigger grants the ability to the Character; therefore you would keep +2 Attack and Pierce 2 for that Battle, similar to cards like Kinetic Intensifier Whip.
