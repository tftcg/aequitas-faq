      <question>If the damage done by Backfire is enough to KO the attacker, does the attacker still do attack damage?</question>
      <answer>No. You reveal Backfire before battle cards are flipped. In fact, if Backfire KOâ€™s the attacker, the attack will end and no one flips battle cards.</answer>
