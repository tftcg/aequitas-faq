        <question>
            How does Soldier's Blaster (and similar cards) work when interacting with a character who is both an Autobot and a Decepticon? 
        </question>
        <answer>
            Different faction means "does not share a faction identity." For a character which is both an Autobot and a Decepticon, "not sharing a faction identity" means NOT Autobot and NOT Decepticon. Currently, this leaves Mercenary as the only different faction.
