      <question>
If I have a LV Gamma Disruptor Launcher on Shockwave and play a Dual Wield for my turn, giving Shockwave another Weapon slot, and I play another LV Gamma as my upgrade for the turn, then attack. Since 2 LV gammas are allowed in one weapon slot, I presume the one attached by Dual Wield will stay on as well?

      <answer>
Yes.

      <question>
If I play Dual Wield on a mercenary who has no weapons on him originally, do I have to discard that weapon at the end of turn, or because I still have an open weapon slot can I keep that weapon?
        </question>
      <answer>
You do not! You can keep it in the original Weapon slot.
