      <question>If my opponent has Secret Actions in their hand, scrap pile, or even in their KO area (say because of Daring Escape), do those count?</question>
      <answer>No. Decipher counts only the Secret Actions in your opponentâ€™s played area.</answer>

            <question>
                If my opponent has one face up Secret Action and two face down Secret Actions, do I do 1 damage to each enemy, or 3?
            </question>
            <answer>
                You would do 1 damage to each enemy, then 1 damage again, and then finally 1 damage again. The 'or' in "face up or face down" should be read as 'and/or', and the damage is one at a time rather than all at once.
