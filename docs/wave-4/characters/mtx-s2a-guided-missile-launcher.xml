      <question>This Weapon can be in an Armor or Utility slot. When I play it, do I have to say which slot it’s in?</question>
      <answer>Yes. Usually, players indicate which slot an Upgrade is in by placing it on a particular side of the character: Weapons on the left, Armors on the right, and Utilities below. Once the Upgrade is in a slot, it can’t be moved to another slot to free up space.</answer>
