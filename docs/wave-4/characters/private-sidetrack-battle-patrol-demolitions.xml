      <question>What happens if I use the tap ability and have fewer than 4 cards in my deck?</question>
      <answer>In that case, scrap all the cards in their deck. Then, setting those cards aside, shuffle all the other cards in your scrap pile into your deck. Then scrap enough cards from your reformed deck to scrap a total of 4 cards. The cards that aren’t Upgrades will be only cards in your scrap pile when you’re done.</answer>
