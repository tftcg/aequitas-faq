      <question>Several cards in this set put battle cards under characters on the battlefield. If my opponent does this, and one of those cards is a Secret Action, will Sergeant Mirage’s ability see it and give him Tough 2?</question>
      <answer>No. Sergeant Mirage’s ability looks only in the played area. Secret Actions that somehow end up in your opponent’s KO area, scrap pile, or under a character on the battlefield don’t count.</answer>
