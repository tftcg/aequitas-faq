      <question>
Revenge on Ratbat and Bounty on Deadlock both trigger upon Ratbat's KO, but which triggers first?
        </question>
      <answer>
Bounty abilities and Revenge abilities will usually trigger at the same time. Bounty abilities are usually handled first because they belong to the active player.
