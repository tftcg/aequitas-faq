      <question>
What happens when I play Medic's Protective Field on Private Smokescreen (Alt Mode)?
        </question>
      <answer>
Because the Safeguard value is the same, having two instances of it has no additional effect. Smokescreen can’t take more than 3 damage if undamaged. However, if a character has two instances of Safeguard with different values, the lowest value wins. For example, if a character has Safeguard 1 and Safeguard 3, that character can’t take more than 1 damage if undamaged.
