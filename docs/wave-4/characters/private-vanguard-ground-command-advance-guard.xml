      <question>How does Private Vanguard’s ability interact with effects that modify how much attack damage a character takes, such as Blast Suit.</question>
      <answer>That ability doesn’t directly modify how much attack damage is being done to the character (note it doesn’t use “instead”), so it waits for effects like Blast Suit to apply, then sees if the character is taking more than 5 attack damage. If it is, the character takes 5 attack damage.</answer>
