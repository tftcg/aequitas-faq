      <question>
Nightbird stealing cards from an opponent's scrap pile: Can I keep them after playing them?
        </question>
      <answer>
No. Any action you play from your opponent’s scrap pile goes into your played area, and eventually back to their scrap pile. (Cards always go to their owner’s hand, deck, KO area, and scrap pile).

            <question>
                If you attack with Nightbird and use her bounty ability, can you use steamroll from the opponent's scrap pile?
            </question>
            <answer>
                You can play the Steamroll, however you cannot use it for Nightbird's attack as by the time Steamroll is played, Nightbird's damage was already applied and the defender was already KO'd. If you happen to attack again on that same turn, Steamroll could be usefully applied to an attacker.
