      <question>
Nightbird stealing cards from an opponent's scrap pile: Can I keep them after playing them?
        </question>
      <answer>
No. Any action you play from your opponent’s scrap pile goes into your played area, and eventually back to their scrap pile. (Cards always go to their owner’s hand, deck, KO area, and scrap pile).
