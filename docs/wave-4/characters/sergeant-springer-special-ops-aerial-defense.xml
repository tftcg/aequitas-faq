      <question>Let’s say I have exactly 7 cards in my hand when I flip Sergeant Springer to bot mode. Its ability triggers and I play an Action. Now I only have 6 cards in hand. Do I still get to play an Upgrade?</question>
      <answer>Yes. Once the ability triggers, you’ll do everything it says. The trigger condition doesn’t recheck in the middle.</answer>

      <question>
For Showing Off, can I flip Sergeant Springer to one alt mode and use its effect then flip to the other Alt mode and use its effect too? Or must I resolve Showing Off completely first?
        </question>
      <answer>
Showing Off resolves completely before any abilities that triggered happen.
