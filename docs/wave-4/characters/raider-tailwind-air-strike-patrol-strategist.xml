      <question>
If I equip Crash Landing on an Air Strike Patrol bot that is buffed by Tailwind's +2 Attack, does it trigger Crash Landing with the extra Attack?
        </question>
      <answer>
Crash Landing will do damage based on whatever the plane’s attack was when it was last on the battlefield. Bonuses like Tailwind’s will still apply because the plane is KO’d during the battle.
