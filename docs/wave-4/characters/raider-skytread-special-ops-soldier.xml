      <question>What happens if my last two characters are those two and they’re both KO’d at the same time. Dpo their Revenge abilities work and keep me in the game?</question>
      <answer>Unfortunately, no. Once your last character is KO’d, you lose the game. Fortunately, having them both KO’d at the same time is pretty unusual.</answer>

      <question>Both Revenge abilities put cards from my hand under Raider Skytread. What does this mean?</question>
      <answer>The cards under Raider Skytread are basically out of play for a while. They’re not considered on the battlefield, even if that’s where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. If one of those cards is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn’t on Raider Skytread, and so on. They’re also not in your scrap pile, so they won’t be shuffled into your deck when it’s empty. They can return to your hand using Raider Skytread’s last ability.</answer>

      <question>
If my opponent KO’s Skytread (whichever), what happens to his Upgrades? Are they Scrapped? Are they eligible to be transferred to Raider Skytread? Can I choose to Scrap a Reactive Armor even if the other piece doesn't have an Armor?
        </question>
      <answer>
If Skytread (whichever) has any upgrades prior to combining, those upgrades are scrapped. Raider Skytread can keep the upgrades from the Skytread (whichever) that was on the battlefield and not KO’d.

      <question>
Do Omega Supreme and Skytread’s separate uncombined character cards count as separate characters for the purposes of "Choose one of your characters" cards?  Most notable example is if I play Two-Pronged Attack on "Skytread (Plane)", do I also get the tank trigger, or do I only get the Plane trigger?
        </question>
      <answer>
While uncombined, each character is separate. If you play Two-Pronged Attack on Skytread (Plane), you’ll only get the damage effect.

      <question>
The answer from the last rules roundup states that the new combiners (Omega Supreme and Skytread) keep all upgrades and damage when they combine. Even with that explanation, rule enforcers where I play tell me that it doesn't apply to the KO'd Skytread's upgrades and that those upgrades are scrapped during the KO process before Revenge combining takes place and do not transfer to the combined Skytread. Can I please get a specific ruling on this?
        </question>
      <answer>
Upgrades attached to the Skytread half that gets KO’d are scrapped at the same time. Those upgrades can’t be put on Raider Skytread.

        <question>
            Are the cards placed under Skytread randomized or placed in a specific order?
        </question>
        <answer>
            The cards are face down and therefore randomized.

            <question>
                Can you use I Still Function! to combine Skytread?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. Skytread's combine effect is a 'may', which means you can allow one of your Skytread pieces to KO and opt not to combine. On your turn, you can then bring a the Skytread piece back from the KO area using I Still Function!, and then when the returned character KO's at the end of your turn, you would be able to combine to form Raider Skytread. If all characters were tapped, they would have been untapped before the I Still Function! KO, so you would not be able to attack out with the newly combined Raider Skytread.
