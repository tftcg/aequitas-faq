      <question>
If I’m playing Metroplex and I get KO’d in round one, can I sideboard in Trypticon?
        </question>
      <answer>
Your character sideboard is allowed 1 character with 19 stars or fewer. Trypticon is too big for this and is wondering why you’re not just running him on your team to begin with.
