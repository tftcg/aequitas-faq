      <question>What happens if I have fewer than 5 cards in my deck when I flip Captain Jetfire to alt mode?</question>
      <answer>In that case you’ll reveal as many cards as you can from your deck, then—leaving those cards aside—shuffle your scrap pile to rebuild your deck. Then reveal more cards so a total of 5 are revealed. The revealed cards that aren’t Upgrades will be only cards in your scrap pile when you’re done.</answer>
