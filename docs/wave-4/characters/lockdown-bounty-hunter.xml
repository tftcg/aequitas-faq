      <question>Lockdown’s Bounty ability puts a card from the bottom of my deck under himself. What does it mean when a card is under Lockdown?</question>
      <answer>The cards under Lockdown are basically out of play for a while. They’re not considered on the battlefield, even if that’s where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. If one of those cards is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn’t on Lockdown, and so on. They’re also not in your scrap pile, so they won’t be shuffled into your deck when it’s empty. They’re just used to keep track of the bonuses from Lockdown’s other abilities.</answer>

      <question>Can I look at the card as it’s put under Lockdown?</question>
      <answer>No. The card is face-down, so neither player can look at it while it’s under Lockdown.</answer>

      <question>
Let's say, in theory, Lockdown has a 4 cards in hand, along with a Weapon, Armor, Utility, and one card underneath him.  Lockdown flips to his alt mode, allowing him to draw 4 discard 4, but I reveal Hijack.  Would I get to draw 4 while Lockdown's player has to pay the discard part of the effect or since he drew 0 cards he discards 0 cards?
        </question>
      <answer>
You draw the 4 cards. The Lockdown player would have to scrap 4 cards. That poor, sweet fool has been Hijacked.
