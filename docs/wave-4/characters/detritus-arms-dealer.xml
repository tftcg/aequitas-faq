      <question>
If I flip a character who lets me play a card for free such as Detritus - Arms Dealer who allows me to play a Black Pip card, can I play a Smoke Cloak this way to give Detritus Tough 1 for that battle, or does it apply after flips have ready happened?

Swerve happens before Battle Cards are flipped, so if you reveal Swerve to flip Detritus in this way and play Smoke Cloak, the Tough 1 would be in place before Battle Cards are flipped..
