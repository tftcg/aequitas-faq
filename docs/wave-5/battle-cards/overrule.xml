      <question>
Do character abilities still trigger if the requirements are met through cards played but negated by the opponent or otherwise?
For example, Wave 1 Thundercracker’s bot mode ability --&gt; Player 1 uses Supercharge, but player 2 reveals Infiltrate and negates Supercharge. Does Thundercracker's ability still trigger because an action was played? Meaning he would indeed get +1?
</question>
      <answer>
The Infiltrate will scrap the action you played and negate its effect, but Thundercracker’s ability still triggers because you played an action.

          <tftcg-note>This is also true for other cards that cancel an Action, such as Jam Signals, Overrule, and Speed Trap, and for any other effects (like Thundercracker) related to playing a card. </tftcg-note>

                I am playing Nightbird in alt mode. My opponent plays Brainstorm and 2 follow-up actions. I reveal a Secret Action to stop 1 of the follow-ups. Does my opponent still take 3 damage?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. Even when cancelled by an action such as Infiltrate, Jam Signals, or Overrule, a card is still played and an effects that refer to cards, or number of cards, being played still occur. Another example would be Thundercracker, Mach Warrior's bot mode effect.
