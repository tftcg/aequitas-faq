        <question>
            Does the bot mode ability on Motormaster still trigger when my opponent reveals an End Hostilities?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, it would be unable to trigger cause your oranges would be blues so your attack will not meet the flipped icons requirement. Note: Your own Belligerence would also cause the ability to fail.
