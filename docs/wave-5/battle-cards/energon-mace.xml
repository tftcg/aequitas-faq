                If the upgraded character is attacking an Autobot Leader, does it also get +1 attack from the first ability?

                Yes. Both abilities apply and the upgraded character gets +1 attack and Pierce 3.

            <question>
                If one of my characters has a Weapon or Utility in its Armor slot (e.g. Energon Mace), can I play Ghost Shield to upgrade that character?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. In order to play Ghost Shield, it must replace an Armor in that slot.

          Can I put this on Decepticons?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes, just because it is an Autobot card doesn’t mean that restricts who you can play it on. Take Energon Mace as an inverse example.
