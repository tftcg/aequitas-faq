                How does the effect of Lucky Dodge interact with other effects that modify how much damage a defending character would take?
            </question>
            <answer>
                If there are multiple effects trying to modify how much damage one of your defending characters would take, you may apply those effects in any order you choose. If applying such an effect means your character would take an even amount of damage, you don't reveal Lucky Dodge.
