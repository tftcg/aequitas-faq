            <question>
                Let's say the upgraded character normally has 10 health. It gets upgraded with Enhanced Power Cell, then gets 12 damage counters. If Enhanced Power Cell is scrapped, what happens?

                Any time the game notices a character with a number of damage counters equal to or greater than its current health, the character is KO'd. So your character is KO'd. Sorry.
