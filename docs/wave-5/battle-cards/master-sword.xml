            <question>
                If an effect puts a Weapon directly onto the battlefield without playing it, can I put Master Sword on a character that didn't have a Weapon?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. As long as you're not playing Master Sword, its first ability won't apply.

            <question>
                If one of my characters has an Armor or Utility in its Weapon slot, can I play Master Sword to upgrade that character?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. In order to play Master Sword, it must replace a Weapon in that slot.
