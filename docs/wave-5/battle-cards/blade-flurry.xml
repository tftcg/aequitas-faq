                What happens if the character has a Weapon when I play Blade Flurry, but it loses it before it attacks?
            </question>
            <answer>
                It will still have the +4 attack bonus. The bonus is determined when you play Blade Flurry and won't change even if the character gains or loses a Weapon later in the turn.

          What happens if I play an Armor after I play Armored Assault?   
        </question>
        <answer>
          Similar to Blade Flurry, it will not gain the Bold 1.  The bonus is determined when you play Armored Assault and won't change even if the character gains or loses an Armor later in the turn.
