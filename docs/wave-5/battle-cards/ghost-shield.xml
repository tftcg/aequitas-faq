                If an effect puts an Armor directly onto the battlefield without playing it, can I put Ghost Shield on a character that didn't have an Armor?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. As long as you're not playing Ghost Shield, its first ability won't apply.

            <question>
                If one of my characters has a Weapon or Utility in its Armor slot (e.g. Energon Mace), can I play Ghost Shield to upgrade that character?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. In order to play Ghost Shield, it must replace an Armor in that slot.
