            <question>
                If a character flips a hybrid battle icon during attack/defense and the character is not the relevant trait, is it considered a battle card with no battle icons?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. If, for example, Barricade flipped a Hull Down, it is considered a battle card with 1 orange battle icon for the purposes of any flip effects and not a card with no battle icons. Of course, as Barricade is not a Tank, it does not provide him with +1 to his attack.

          What does it mean to be a Tank and Plane in Bot mode?   
        </question>
        <answer>
          It means that any cards that reference being in Plane or Tank mode are active in both of Overlordâ€™s modes.  This means cards like Composite Armor can be put on him in either mode.  When you flip a Hull Down in either mode it is active, etc.
