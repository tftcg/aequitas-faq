            Does the bot mode ability on Motormaster still trigger when my opponent reveals an End Hostilities?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, it would be unable to trigger cause your oranges would be blues so your attack will not meet the flipped icons requirement. Note: Your own Belligerence would also cause the ability to fail.

          What happens if my opponent plays a Belligerence, I reveal DaD, and I flip a Matrix of Leadership and Master of Metallikato on defense?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Belligerence would turn this flip of normally [OU, (OUB)] to [OO, (OOB)], meaning that you only flipped 2 colors on defense--Orange and Black, regardless of your characterâ€™s tratis--and would thus get +2 DEF for that battle.
