            <question>
                Does a stratagem changing the attack/defence of a character change the base values for the character?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. For example, if Private Pteraxadonâ€™s Binary Edgewing Scythe upgrade mode removes the base defense from a defending Windblade, Combiner Hunter, it would not remove the +1 from the Camien Toughness stratagem.
