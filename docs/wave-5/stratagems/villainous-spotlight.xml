            <question>
                Are the characters under Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Transport) and Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Aircraft Carrier) part of your starting team?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. They are added to the field after you present your starting team.

                As an example, if your team is the three pieces of Tidal Wave and you are going to place a 4-star Autobot, such as Private Top Shot, under Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Transport), you may still play the Villainous Spotlight stratagem because your starting team was only Decepticons.

        <answer>
          Characters like Optimus Prime, Dark Awakening belong to multiple factions at once – in Dark Awakening’s case, Autobot and Quintesson. They are not disallowed for the purposes of Spotlight Stratagems. For example, Decepticon Exhaust, Consumptive Condottiere is valid for either Villainous Spotlight or Enterprising Spotlight. Additionally, both Armada, Herald of Shrouds and Decepticon Exhaust would be able to use a Scoundrel’s Blaster.
