            <question>
                When do you choose to add stratagems out of your sideboard? When declaring characters or when sideboarding battlecards?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Stratagems are played concurrently with the starting team for a game. This is required otherwise cards like Master Converter and Aerial Enhancements would not effect the starting team, leading Windsweeper to be sad when Blitzwing and Tracks don't count as Planes.
