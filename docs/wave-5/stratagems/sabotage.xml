                What does "being upgraded" mean on Gearsâ€™ stratagem Sabotage?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Being upgraded covers any time an upgrade is Put on a character (including Playing, Moving, and Swapping). It does not cover when an upgrade remains on a character during combining.
