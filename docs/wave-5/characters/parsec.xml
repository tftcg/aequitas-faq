        <question>
            My opponent has a Fangry with Parsec; does Drift have Stealth from him in alt mode?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, Fangry may have the Autobot Tag, but is still a Decepticon and Drift’s Ability will grant him Stealth against him. This is in line with the WotC ruling of inclusivity of Faction;having “Stealth against Decepticons” might as well read “Stealth against Decepticons+”.  If there were ever a situation in the future where a dual-faction Decepticon-Mercenary was available to your opponent, Drift would have Stealth from that character, as well.
