            <question>
                Are the characters under Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Transport) and Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Aircraft Carrier) part of your starting team?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. They are added to the field after you present your starting team.

                As an example, if your team is the three pieces of Tidal Wave and you are going to place a 4-star Autobot, such as Private Top Shot, under Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Transport), you may still play the Villainous Spotlight stratagem because your starting team was only Decepticons.

            <question>
                Do Tidal Waveâ€™s deployable 4-stars need to be included in a deck list, or can they be switched out between games independently of the sideboard?
            </question>
            <answer>
                The deployable 4-star characters do not need to be listed in a deck list, allowing different characters to be used in different games. The correct play is for each player to present their starting team to each other, and then the Tidal Wave player fetches their 4-star character, or characters, shows them to their opponent to confirm they are 4 stars or fewer, and places them under the relevant Tidal Wave cards.
