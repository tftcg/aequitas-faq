            <question>
                Can Sky Shadow Sync be used in a deck that already includes Ominus, allowing you to potentially have two Ominus card's on the battlefield at the same time?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. Sky Shadow Sync says "When ... you have Ominus outside the game". If Ominus was on your starting team, then Ominus is inside the game and Sky Shadow Sync will not trigger.
