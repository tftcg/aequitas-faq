                What is a trait?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Traits are things like Melee, Leader, or Tank. They usually appear as tabbed icons near the character's name.

            <question>
                If I pick a character that shares more than one trait with Tracks, does it get a bigger bonus?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. The character will get a maximum of +2 attack, even if it's a Car and a Melee character.
