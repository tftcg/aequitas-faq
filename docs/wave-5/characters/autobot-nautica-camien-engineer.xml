                Doesn't the character always get +1 defense for each blue battle icon that's flipped?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Autobot Nautica's bonus is in addition to the normal blue battle icon effect. Essentially, she gets +2 defense for each blue battle icon flipped.

            <question>
                How does Nautica's body mode work with Emergency Barricade and Crystal of Power?
            </question>
            <answer>
                If, when defending, you upgrade Nautica with an Emergency Barricade, it will remain on her until the next time she defends. This is because the 'when defends' event has already happened before Emergency Barricade was played. If, when defending, you upgrade her with Crystal of Power, it will remain until the next time she battles.
