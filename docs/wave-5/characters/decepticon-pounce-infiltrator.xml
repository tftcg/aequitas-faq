            <question>
                If I have one face up Secret Action and one face down Secret Action, do I get +2 attack or +4 attack?
            </question>
            <answer>
                You get +4 attack. The 'or' in "face up or face down" should be read as 'and/or'.

            <question>
                If I have Secret Actions in my hand, scrap pile, under a character, or even in my KO area (say because of Daring Escape), do those count?
            </question>
            <answer>
                 No. Pounce counts only the Secret Actions in your played area.
