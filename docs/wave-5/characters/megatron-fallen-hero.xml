            <question>
                If Megatron defends and I flip at least one orange battle icon, but Megatron is KO'd in the attack, will his ability still work and do 1 damage to the attacker?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. Once Megatron's ability triggers, it will still work even if Megatron if KO'd.
