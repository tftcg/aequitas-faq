            <question>
                What happens if Topspin defends and doesn't have Bold?
            </question>
            <answer>
                In that case, his ability won't do anything. Perhaps there's a head that will give him Bold?

                If Topspin has Bold 1 and Tough 1 and defends, what happens?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Topspin's own ability will add to any Tough total he already has. In that example, he'll have Tough 2 and flip 2 more battle cards.
