            <question>
                 If your opponent KOs one of your characters, other than the Battleship, and you play an I Still Function! to bring that character back, does Tidal Wave combine at the end of turn?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes, Tidal Wave does combine. WotC (Drew) confirmed this in a comment to this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transformerstcg/permalink/2998793173489493/">community poll</a>.
