            <question>
                Are the characters under Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Transport) and Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Aircraft Carrier) part of your starting team?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. They are added to the field after you present your starting team.

                As an example, if your team is the three pieces of Tidal Wave and you are going to place a 4-star Autobot, such as Private Top Shot, under Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Transport), you may still play the Villainous Spotlight stratagem because your starting team was only Decepticons.

            <question>
                 If your opponent KOs one of your characters, other than the Battleship, and you play an I Still Function! to bring that character back, does Tidal Wave combine at the end of turn?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes, Tidal Wave does combine. WotC (Drew) confirmed this in a comment to this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transformerstcg/permalink/2998793173489493/">community poll</a>.
