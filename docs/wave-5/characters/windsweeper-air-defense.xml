            <question>
                For the purposes of Windsweeper's alt-mode ability, is Blitzwing a Plane on your starting team?

            <answer>
                No. Your starting team are the visible cards you present to your opponent at the beginning of the game to show you have an acceptable numbers of stars. These are the sides of the cards that show their star cost. 

                Given this, Blitzwing is a Tank on your starting team unless you are playing the Master Converter stratagem, in which case Blitzwing is both a Tank and Plane on your starting team.
