                How many stratagems can I play?
            </question>
            <answer>
                You can play up to one stratagem for each different character, trait, or faction listed on the stratagem, as long as your starting team includes that character, trait, or faction. For example, if your starting team is all Autobots and includes Optimus Prime - Legendary Warrior, you can play both Heroic Spotlight and Duty &amp; Honor.

        <question>
            If Optimus - Legendary Warrior attacks in bot-mode with less characters than your opponent and you choose to repair a character upgraded with Toolbox, will you repair 4 because there are two times, or is it just 3 because it is one time repairing?
        </question>
        <answer>
            It's repair 1 "then" repair 1. So Toolbox will change it to repair 2, then repair 2, for a total of 4.
