            <question>
                When Chromedome flips to body mode and you get to KO an opponent's Action, does that trigger Decepticon Shockwave's bot mode?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. The Action is 'put' into the KO area, not scrapped, thus it does not trigger Decepticon Shockwave's bot mode.
