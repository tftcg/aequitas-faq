            <question>
                Slipstream (alt mode) is attacking Skullsmasher (body mode). Does Slipstream pass a damage then take a damage, or does she take a damage and then pass a damage?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Looking at the <a href="https://www.tf-rules.info/rules/Expanded_Rules.html#_attack">Expanded Rules</a>, an attacker taps in 1.3.1.2, whereas an attacker's "when this attacks" trigger happens at 1.3.1.5. Therefore Skullsmasher triggers first, doing a damage to Slipstream, and then Slipstream moves a damage to the defender.
