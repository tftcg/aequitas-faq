          <question>
              With respect to Perceptor's alt mode ability, is zero a pile?
          </question>
          <answer>
              Yes, zero is a pile. It is perfectly fine to split the cards into two piles, one of four cards and one of zero. Listen to this <a href="https://youtu.be/VMqWDWBo2ro?t=1822">designer interview</a> for confirmation (30:26 into the interview).
