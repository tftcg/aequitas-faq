        <answer>
          Press the Advantage is banned in many formats (including Bayformers-sponsored formats), but recent tournaments have shown its ability matches current card power levels post-Wave 5. United Against Tyranny is intended to be a PtA replacement that allows for PtA’s general card utility without PtA’s degenerate green battle icon.
          We recommend that formats that have both unbanned Press the Advantage and support Team Bayformers cards also ban United Against Tyranny, as it is intended to be a replacement for PtA.
