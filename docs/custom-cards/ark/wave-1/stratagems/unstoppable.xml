            As the trigger resolves, you can put zero, one, two, three, or four upgrades from your scrap pile into the KO area.  If you put one or more upgrades into the KO area this way, Wreck-Gar returns to the battlefield and repairs 2 damage for each of them.  If you manage to put another upgrade into the KO area during your start of turn, before resolving this ability, you can increase the amount of damage repaired from Wreck-Gar this way.  Currently, however, there is no way to do this.
