            You can choose any of your characters when you play this card, even if they donâ€™t have the appropriate trait.  However, the attack and pierce bonus does not apply to that character unless they have the Plane, Helicopter, and/or Spaceship traits and the enemy they attack has the Car, Truck, and/or Tank traits.
