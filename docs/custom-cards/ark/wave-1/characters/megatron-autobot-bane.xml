            The ability of the P38 Fusion Blaster to redeploy Megatron to the battlefield is a replacement effect that prevents him from going to the KO area if he was upgrading a Decepticon Leader that has 10 stars or more. This includes a card scrapping him, such as an opposing Ramming Speed, or if the game itself tries to scrap him due to the character he is upgrading was KO’d.

            If the character Megatron is upgrading is your last character, and is KO’d, you will lose the game before Megatron redeploys, as his ability does not prevent the game from seeing you with no valid characters, unlike Ghost of Starscream or Titan Masters.
