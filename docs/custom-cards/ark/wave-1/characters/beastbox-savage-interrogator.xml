            The attack bonus in bot mode lasts until end of turn.  If Beastbox attacks an Autobot multiple times in a turn, he gets the bonus for each attack.

            If you play a card from the opponent’s deck with Beastbox’s alt mode ability, you are considered the owner of its effects if any other cards or abilities trigger off of it.  That card then goes to the opponent’s scrap pile when it would normally be scrapped (usually the end of turn).
