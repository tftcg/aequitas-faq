        <question>
            If I start with Overkill on my team, can I put an Overkill from outside the game into my KO area?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, this will be more covered in a Tournament Rules Doc. You may only ever have one of each named character on your battlefield or in the KO area. This concept is further emphasized by the word “different” among the many abilities in this same vein.
