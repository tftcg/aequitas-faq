            Can this take an Improvised Shield from my opponent’s hand?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, even though it is only Orange Pips, it's still more than one of them. The pure number of icons is the condition, not the number of colors.

            Can this take blank pip cards from my opponent’s hand?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, because blank, or zero icons, is less than one.
