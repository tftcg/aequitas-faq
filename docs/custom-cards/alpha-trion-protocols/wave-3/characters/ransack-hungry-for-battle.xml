        <question>
          Does Ransack’s first Alt ability count himself?
        </question>
        <answer>
          No, he says *other* Insecticon on your starting team. If your team was 4 Insecticons, including him, your deck could have up to 3 extra stars in it.

        <question>
          Is Ransack’s flip-to-Alt ability optional; do I have to do it if I have an Upgrade I could scrap?
        </question>
        <answer>
          The ability is mandatory, if you have an Upgrade--so be careful about flipping this guy!

        <question>
          Does Raider Brunt or Acid Storm stop Ransack’s Bot mode flipping of extra cards in battle?
        </question>
        <answer>
          No, those characters care about Bold; this mechanic is similar to Bold, but is not the named mechanic unless keyworded as such.
