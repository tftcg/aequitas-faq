        <answer>
          When Axor, Opportunistic Fencer’s ability is activated for your Mercenary, the Bounty activated still belongs to the Mercenary and not to Axor. For example, Axor cannot repair 3 of his damage due to activating Detritus’s Bounty, though Detritus should repair 3 damage on Detritus.
