          The stat bonuses on This Gun for Hire affect all stat boxes in each mode of Shockblast, Galactic Man. Therefore, with this Stratagem in play, Shockblast in alt mode has 4 Attack and 9 Health, Shockblast in bot mode has 3 Attack and 9 Health, and the Astro Magnum grants +3 Attack to an upgraded character.
