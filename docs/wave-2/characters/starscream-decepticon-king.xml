      <question>What happens if I flip more than one Decepticon Crown in the same battle?</question>
      <answer>Starscream—sorry—King Starscream—’s ability will trigger once for each Decepticon Crown you flip. Hit 2 of them and get +6 to your attack and defense for the turn.</answer>

      <question>
If I attack with Starscream - Decepticon King in bot mode and flip multiple Decepticon Crowns, does his effect trigger multiple times on the same attack?
      </question>
      <answer>
Yes. Starscream gets his bonus for each crown flipped. It is the most Starscream of all Starscream moves.

      <question>
I attack with Starscream - Decepticon King in Bot mode, who is equipped with Recon System. I flip battle cards and flip a Decepticon Crown. If I use Recon System to scrap Decepticon Crown, does Starscream still get its effect since Decepticon Crown was flipped, despite it being scrapped later?
      </question>
      <answer>
Yes.
