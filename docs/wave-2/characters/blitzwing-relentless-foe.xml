When I attack with Blitzwing - Relentless Foe and don't flip at least [Orange][Blue]... I don't draw a card, but can I still flip to other mode after the battle?

No, you may not. That is all one ability.

      <question>
For Blitzwing in bot mode, do you always flip to alt mode after battling, whether on attack or defense, or only after flipping an orange and blue during the attack phase?
      </question>
      <answer>
It’s all one ability. You won’t flip Blitzwing unless you’ve flipped an orange and a blue battle icon during the attack.
