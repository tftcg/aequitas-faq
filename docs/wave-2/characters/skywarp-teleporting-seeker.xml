      <question>
Can someone explain Skywarp's wave 2 ability? If a card with no battle icons is flipped by Skywarp or another one of your characters, it boosts his attack and defense stats by three. If he flips into his other mode, does he retain the stats? When you state end of turn on a card, does it mean the end of the character’s attack or the end of all characters’ attacks in that round, which would result in all characters untapping and the start of the next round?
      </question>
      <answer>
If Skywarp gets the +3 attack and defense until the end of turn bonus and then flips to his alt mode, he’ll keep that bonus for the entire turn. Any effect that lasts “until end of turn” or “this turn” lasts the entire turn, meaning your attacks are done and your opponent’s turn is about to begin.

If I use I Still Function to bring back Skywarp - Teleporting Seeker from the KO area, does his ability trigger (assuming he's on his bot mode)?
</question>
      <answer>
No. The ability only functions on the battlefield. By the time he’s returned to the battlefield, you’ve already played I Still Function.
