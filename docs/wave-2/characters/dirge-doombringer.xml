      <question>What happens if I play Steamroll and choose Dirge?</question>
      <answer>If you attack with Dirge and it does more than enough attack damage to KO the defender, Steamroll’s ability will work, but Dirge’s ability won’t trigger. If Dirge does exactly enough damage to KO the defender, Steamroll won’t do anything.</answer>
