      <question>If Air Raid has an Upgrade that does damage to an enemy, will Air Raid’s ability trigger and let me scrap an Upgrade from that enemy?</question>
      <answer>No, unless the Upgrade specifically says that the upgraded character does the damage. Air Raid must do the damage for the ability to trigger.</answer>

      <question>
Does Air Raid's bot mode ability trigger if you use Armed Hovercraft to do 1 damage to an enemy team?
      </question>
      <answer>
Armed Hovercraft does the damage, not the character that has it equipped.

      <question>
My opponent's Air Raid (Bot Mode) attacks my Sunstorm (with Crash Landing), doing enough Damage to KO Sunstorm. Air Raid's player is able to Scrap the Crash Landing before I can use it to KO an Aerialbot, correct?
      </question>
      <answer>
In this scenario, Air Raid’s ability can’t do anything because Sunstorm has been KO’d and as a result, his upgrades have been scrapped. Crash Landing’s effect will work.
