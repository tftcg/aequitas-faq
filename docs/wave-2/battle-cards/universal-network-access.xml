      <question>
Say I have 2 copies of Universal Network Access (Or any star card) in my deck, and I use Unleash Potential to bring a third copy into my hand. Fast forward a bit, and I manage to play Unleash Potential again. Could I use that to bring a fourth copy of that card into the game or does the rule of three still apply?

      <answer>
The rule only applies when building your deck. In this scenario you could bring in another copy.
