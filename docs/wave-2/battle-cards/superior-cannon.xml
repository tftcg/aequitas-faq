      <question>
Megatron - Arrogant Ruler’s ability says "If you flip to this mode you may play an upgrade”, Does this include all Superior Upgrades? (Jetpack, Plating, Cannon, etc.)
      </question>
      <answer>
Yes, but only if you’ve already played Tech Research. Megatron’s ability doesn’t get around that requirement.
