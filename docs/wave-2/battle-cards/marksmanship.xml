      <question>
I couldn’t find this having been asked before - if Marksmanship is played against a Combiner - does this do the 2 damage? Are Combiners in bot mode? 
      </question>
      <answer>
Combiner mode is not the same as bot mode, so Marksmanship would not do 2 damage.

      <question>
Are Combiners are considered to be in bot mode? I realize they say ‘Combiner’ in that slot but asking because of cards like Marksmanship. Can that target a combiner?
      </question>
      <answer>
Combiner mode is a new third mode that is different than bot mode, so Marksmanship, for example, would not be applicable to a Combiner.
