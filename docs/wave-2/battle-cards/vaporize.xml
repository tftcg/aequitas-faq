      <question>
Say Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend attack a character with a Body Armor equipped, during the attack, Vaporize is revealed as attacking, and I choose to use the Vaporize on the Body Armor, does the defender still have tough 3?
      </question>
      <answer>
OPBLâ€™s ability says it triggers before defense flips, so the defender would lose that tough 3 in this scenario.
