      <question>
Does Battering Ram function like Cornered! when attacking, so that your opponent gets the ability of the mode flipped to? For example, General Optimus Prime has Battering Ram and hits my Nemesis, flipping him to alt mode. So now my opponent should assign 2 damage to a character of his choice, correct?
</question>
      <answer>
Yes. Battering Ram causes your opponent to flip the character, so abilities like Nemesis’ will trigger.
