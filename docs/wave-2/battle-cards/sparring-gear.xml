      <question>
If I start my turn with 3 Attack Drones and a Sparring Gear on General Megatron, does that count as 4 Upgrades (Meaning each Attack Drone counts, and therefore trigger his ability), or only 2, since only 2 slots are filled?
      </question>
      <answer>
Yes, each Attack Drone counts individually, so that is 4 upgrades, triggering General Megatronâ€™s bot mode ability.

      <question>
My question is about the interaction of Debilitating Crystal and the new Expanded Rules document. If my attacker has a Debilitating Crystal, and the Defender has a Gyro Blaster I wish to return, I believe the Gyro Blaster would still limit each character to 2 flips this battle. Is this correct? I know a previous Rules Roundup clarified that a Security Console would still Draw and Plan even if a Debilitating Crystal returned it. Is this also the case with a Sparring Gear I wish to return? Do they still have Tough 2 this battle?
        </question>
      <answer>
Expanded Rules point 8.5 indicates the Gyro Blaster is returned before flips are determined, so it will not affect them. Likewise, Sparring Gear will no longer grant Tough 2 when flips are determined.
