      <question>If I want to play a Weapon on the upgraded character, do I choose which slot it goes in?</question>
      <answer>Yes. If you want the Weapon in its Armor slot, put it to the right of Megatron, where an Armor would normally go. Once the Weapon is in a slot, it can’t move to another slot. This means that if you put a Weapon into its Armor slot, you’d have to scrap that Weapon if later you wanted to play an Armor on it.</answer>

      <question>If I have a Weapon in the upgraded character’s Armor slot and Tooth and Claw is removed from the character, what happens to the Weapon?</question>
      <answer>It stays where it is. Once an Upgrade is legally put into a slot, removing what made it legal to put it there doesn’t matter.</answer>

      <question>
I have a Torox with Tooth and Claw and Mining Pick in his Armor Slot, as well as Divebomb with a Field Communicator. If I combine them into Predaking via the Predacon Enigma, am I required to keep Tooth and Claw in order to carry the Mining Pick to Predaking's armor slot, or can I bring the Field Communicator instead?
        </question>
      <answer>
Once an Upgrade is legally put into a slot, it stays there, even if the ability that allowed it to be upgraded in the first place no longer applies. In your example, you could keep Mining Pick in Predaking’s Armor slot. Upgrades that are on characters that combine into Combiners are considered to stay in their slots, even though those slots now belong to the Combiner.

      <question>
Say I have Razorclaw equipped with Tooth and Claw, and because of that effect Razorclaw has a Grenade Launcher in its armor slot. If I combine into Predaking, can I transfer the Grenade Launcher from Razorclaw's armor slot to Predaking's armor slot?
      </question>
      <answer>
You would have to keep Tooth and Claw to keep the Grenade Launcher for Predaking’s armor slot.
