      <question>Do I count the Focus Fire I’m playing?</question>
      <answer>Yes. The first one gives one of your characters bold 1.</answer>

      <question>If I play a second Focus Fire, can I give the same character bold 1 twice?</question>
      <answer>Yes. You can give one character bold 1 twice (which is just like giving it bold 2), or you can give two separate characters bold 1.</answer>

      <question>
Say I use Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend's Bot Mode skill to use a Focus Fire and I also had 2 Focus Fires in my hand. Since I technically played the Focus Fire I flipped, would I then be able to play the 2 in my hand right after?
      </question>
      <answer>
Yes, but bold would not have any impact on that attack.

      <question>
Say I play Infiltrate on my turn, then on my opponent's turn they play Focus Fire, which lets them play a second Focus Fire, which then lets them play the 3rd Focus Fire.

If I reveal my Infiltrate and negate their first Focus Fire, does it negate the other 2 as well since the first one is discarded?
</question>
      <answer>
If you negate a Focus Fire, it also negates the ability of Focus Fire to play other instances of Focus Fire, stopping the chain.

      <question>
How does playing multiple Focus Fires simultaneously work? Does each consecutive copy stack with each other copy to produce a pattern of bold like this:-
1 copy- Bold 1
2 copies- Bold 4
3 copies- Bold 9
      </question>
      <answer>
No. Once an action is used, it’s done being used, so the pattern would be:
1 copy - Bold 1
2 copies - Bold 3 total
3 copies - Bold 6 total
