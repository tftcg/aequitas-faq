      <question>Let’s say I play this and choose my opponent’s Decepticon with 1 defense. Later in the turn, it gets +2 defense. What will its total defense be?</question>
      <answer>1. Press the Advantage won’t drop the Decepticon’s defense below 0, but the -2 applies again once the Decepticon’s defense is raised.</answer>

      <question>
If I am playing a team of Decepticon characters, can I still play Press the Advantage? None of my characters would get an attack boost, but a defending Decepticon gets -2 defense?
</question>
      <answer>
Yes, you may play Press the Advantage. You don't have an Autobot to give +2 attack to, but you can still give an enemy Decepticon -2 defense.
Note: Any Decepticons on your team will no longer be welcome at the Decepticon company barbecue after you do this.

      <question>
I attack into my opponents Acid Storm which has 0 defense. Before attacking I play Press the Advantage. My opponent flips defense cards and gets 3 defense. Does Press the Advantage bring him down to 1 defense or because it was played when he had 0 defense does he stay at 0 because the card says he can't go below 0?
      </question>
      <answer>
In this scenario, Press the Advantage would bring your opponent’s character down to 1 defense. Any attack or defense modifiers apply for their stated duration. Only when the result is less than 0 do you use 0 instead.

        <answer>
          Press the Advantage is banned in many formats (including Bayformers-sponsored formats), but recent tournaments have shown its ability matches current card power levels post-Wave 5. United Against Tyranny is intended to be a PtA replacement that allows for PtA’s general card utility without PtA’s degenerate green battle icon.
          We recommend that formats that have both unbanned Press the Advantage and support Team Bayformers cards also ban United Against Tyranny, as it is intended to be a replacement for PtA.
