      <question>
Can Escape Route be used on a triple changer in Alt 2 to flip into Alt 1 and vice-versa? Are triple changers affected by Roll-Out if they are not in bot mode?
        </question>
      <answer>
Escape Route and Roll Out! convert characters from Bot mode to Alt mode. They cannot convert Triple Changers from one Alt mode to another Alt mode.
