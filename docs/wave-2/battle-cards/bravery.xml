      <question>
Since Dreadwing has two upgrades slots, if I have Bravery equipped, can I choose to play another utility to get it off it, or does it get equipped?
      </question>
      <answer>
If a character has an open upgrade slot, new upgrades wonâ€™t cause you to scrap any existing upgrades.
