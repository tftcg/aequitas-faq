            If your character defends and flips at least {O}{B}{U}, both abilities will trigger and you may resolve them in either order.  If you choose to resolve the {O}{U} ability first, and this removes the last damage counter from the character, then the {B} ability will not be able to move a damage from the upgraded character and do nothing.
