          <answer>
            If you flip one or two different colors of battle icons when defending, the upgraded character gets +1 defense and Racing Stripes does 1 damage to the attacker.  If you flip three or four different colors, the upgraded character gets +2 defense and Racing Stripes does 2 damage to the attacker.  If you flip five different colors, the upgraded character gets +3 defense and Racing Stripes does 3 damage to the attacker. While it does not specifically state on the card (at the time of this FAQ), it is intended to only count colors of battle icons. Hybrid icons, such as on Spymasterâ€™s Ruse or Concealing Contrails, will not allow the trigger to go above five.
