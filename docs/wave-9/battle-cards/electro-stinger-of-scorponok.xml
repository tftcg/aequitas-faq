            While your opponent’s cards can’t cause Electro Stinger of Scorponok to be scrapped, it can still be replaced if you put another Utility into this slot. Also, effects like Disarm or Gears can return it to your hand without scrapping it.
            Pierce numbers are additive.  If your Scorponok has all three upgrades, he has Pierce 7.
