          <answer>
            You cannot scrap multiple upgrades with Wreck-Garâ€™s alt mode ability to use it multiple times.  However, if Wreck-Gar battles multiple times in a single turn, you may scrap an upgrade during each of those battles to use the ability, and may choose the same effect or different effects each time.
