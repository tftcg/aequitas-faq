            Ratbat’s bot mode ability “steals” the first card draw your opponents get each turn, except for the normal one they get at the start of the turn.  You may only ever draw one card per turn per opponent this way.

          <answer>
            The number of cards in each player’s hand is determined as the alt mode tap ability resolves.  Any player who has 3 or more cards in hand scraps cards until they have 2 left.  Any player who has 0 or 1 cards in hand draws until they have 2.  Any player with 2 cards in hand does nothing. If multiple players are scrapping cards from their hand due to this effect, the active player chooses the cards in their hand to scrap first, then the nonactive player(s) in turn order. The chosen cards are then scrapped simultaneously.
