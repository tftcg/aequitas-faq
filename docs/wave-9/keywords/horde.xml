            Can I have a character with Horde on my starting team, and one of the Horde-copies in my sideboard?

            No. Horde only applies to your starting team.

            Horde is a static ability that appears on some character cards, followed by a number.  It means “You may have up to X characters with this name on your starting team.”  If a character card has Horde 3, for example, you can play up to one, two, or three copies of that character card on your starting team.
