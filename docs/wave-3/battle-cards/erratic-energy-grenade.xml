      <question>
If you have Energy Pack on an 11-star character who is nearly dead, then attach Erratic Energy Grenade, removing Energy Pack, which KO’s your character automatically since their health bonus is no longer there, does Erratic Energy Grenade’s second effect still activate?
</question>
      <answer>
Yes, Erratic Energy’s Grenade’s second effect would still activate in this scenario. Erratic Energy Grenade replaces Energy Pack without anything happening in between.

      <question>
When I equip Erratic Energy Grenade, do I subtract one health right away? Is the beginning of my turn after everyone is tapped and I reset all the characters, and then that's when I subtract one health? Or is my turn right after my opponent finishes their attack?
</question>
      <answer>
Erratic Energy Grenade does 1 damage at the beginning of your turn.

      <question>
I need a rule clarification about the interaction between Erratic Energy Grenade and Scavenge the Battlefield. I'm assuming that when the character with the grenade is KO'd, and I use Scavenge the Battlefield, I deal 2 damage to each enemy AND I put the grenade onto another character. Am I correct? I'm trying to convert my Constructicons into a football team.
