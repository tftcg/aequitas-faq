      <question>What happens if I play this with 1 or 2 cards left in my deck?</question>
      <answer>You’ll reveal the remaining cards of your deck, then reshuffle your scrap pile. Then reveal cards from the top of your deck until you’ve revealed 3 total cards. Then put them into your hand or scrap pile, depending on their battle icons.</answer>
