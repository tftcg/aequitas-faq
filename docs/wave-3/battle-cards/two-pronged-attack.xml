      <question>
Do Omega Supreme and Skytread’s separate uncombined character cards count as separate characters for the purposes of "Choose one of your characters" cards?  Most notable example is if I play Two-Pronged Attack on "Skytread (Plane)", do I also get the tank trigger, or do I only get the Plane trigger?
        </question>
      <answer>
While uncombined, each character is separate. If you play Two-Pronged Attack on Skytread (Plane), you’ll only get the damage effect.
