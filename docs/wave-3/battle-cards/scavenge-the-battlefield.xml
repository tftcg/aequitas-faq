Cog is equipped to a bot which dies while Scavenge the Battlefield is in effect. Will Cog transfer to another bot or will he leave the Battlefield first and end up in KO area?

      <question>
I need a rule clarification about the interaction between Erratic Energy Grenade and Scavenge the Battlefield. I'm assuming that when the character with the grenade is KO'd, and I use Scavenge the Battlefield, I deal 2 damage to each enemy AND I put the grenade onto another character. Am I correct? I'm trying to convert my Constructicons into a football team.
