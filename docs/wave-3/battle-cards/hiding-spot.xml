      <question>
What happens if someone has Brave and Stealth at the same time, like if I played Hiding Spot on Blitzwing while he was in tank mode, do they cancel out, does the newer stays take effect?
        </question>
      <answer>
They cancel each other out. An attacker is not able to fulfill both conditions, therefore the attacking player can choose a defender as normal.
