      <question>
If I KO my opponent’s Battle Master and it has a Dismantling Claw on it, and it scraps my Dismantling Claw, I think my Dismantling Claw would therefore scrap the newly applied Battle Master due to he is now a weapon on my opponents bot. Is that correct?
</question>
      <answer>
That is correct.

      <question>
Do Dismantling Claw and Reactive Armor trigger when a character dies, since upgrades are scrapped upon KO?
      </question>
      <answer>
When a character is KO’d, all upgrades attached to it are scrapped at the same time. This means they can see each other leave the battlefield, so both Dismantling Claw and Reactive Armor would trigger.
