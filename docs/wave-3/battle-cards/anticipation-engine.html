          Since it sounds like (understandably) that a comprehensive rules document might take a while, perhaps you could answer a more specific timing question then.

Taken to a corner case, how would a player properly process an attack in the following scenario.

Your team:

<a href="/wave-3/characters/specialist-flamewar-special-ops-hunter.html">Specialist Flamewar</a> in bot mode equipped with an Anticipation Engine in her weapon slot, a <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/metal-detector.html">Metal Detector</a> in her Utility slot. She has Focus 2 from her bot mode ability.

Her teammate, Raider Aimless has a <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/decepticon-crown.html">Decepticon Crown</a> equipped in his Utility slot giving out Plan 1 when a Decepticon attacks.

Her other teammate General Optimus Prime is in Alt Mode giving Bold 1 and Tough 1 to his teammates.

What would be the proper sequence of triggers when Specialist Flamewar initiates an attack? Which goes first Plan, Focus, the Equipment Triggers? Which Equipment Triggers first? Can both trigger on the same combat if you have an equipment and an action (or vice versa) as your top 2 cards?

        <div class="answer">
          When <a href="/wave-3/characters/specialist-flamewar-special-ops-hunter.html">Specialist Flamewar</a> attacks, the abilities of Anticipation Engine, <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/metal-detector.html">Metal Detector</a>, and <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/decepticon-crown.html">Decepticon Crown</a> will all trigger. As the attacking player, you will resolve all of those abilities in the order of your choosing, one at a time. Then you will use your Focus ability. Then, you will flip battle cards, including an extra from General Optimus’ Bold 1.

          Regarding <a href="/wave-6/battle-cards/all-out-attack.html">All-Out Attack</a>.<br/>Scenario:

Bumblebee-TL tapped in bot mode, Prowl-MS and Cliffjumper-RW untapped in car mode.<br/>I play All-Out Attack. Cliffjumper attacks and uses Anticipation Engine to trigger a <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/start-your-engines.html">Start Your Engines</a>. Bee flips to car mode, Prowl is irrelevant, Cliffjumper untaps. Using Bee's extra action via flip to alt mode, I play Ready for Action to untap Bee. Cliffjumper finishes his attack. All 3 cars are now untapped.

Am I free to attack again with Cliffjumper?<br/>Am I free to attack with Bee?<br/>Am I free to end my attacks when I choose because of AoA?

          <a href="/wave-6/battle-cards/all-out-attack.html">All-Out Attack</a> says “Each of your untapped Transformers (Editor’s Note: Characters) can attack this turn.” At the time you play All-Out Attack, check which of your characters are untapped. Those characters are allowed to attack this turn, in sequence. They are not, however, required to attack. They can’t attack a second time unless your opponent is tapped out. As usual, you still must attack with at least one character during your turn if you are able.

          The question I have today is in regard to attacking with Anticipation Engine. I am playing with a combiner team, and I have just converted my last character. I don't have the Enigma in my hand to play it, so I play a different action instead. I attack using a character with Anticipation Engine, and flip the Enigma. Am I able to play it, transform, and continue the attack with the Combiner, or does my attack get cancelled and it becomes my opponent's turn? (This is because the Enigma has the Combiner enter play untapped) Update to the question, as I see it was already answered in a previous Rules Round-up.<br/>Anticipation Engine + Enigma = Transformed and attacking, but untapped<br/>You said the character was untapped, but still attacking. Does this mean that my opponent can only attack with one character if they have multiple available?

          I have a question about the interaction between Anticipation Engine and the Enigmas. Let’s say <a href="/wave-2/characters/silverbolt-aerialbot-leader.html">Silverbolt</a> has an Anticipation Engine equipped and the Aerialbots are all in bot mode. He attacks and flips the <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/aerialbot-enigma.html">Aerialbot Enigma</a>. What happens now? If the Aerialbots combine to form Superion does the attack continue, and if so, what is the base attack used to compute damage? Is it Superion’s attack or Silverbolt’s?

          The attack continues, except now Superion (untapped) is attacking the target <a href="/wave-2/characters/silverbolt-aerialbot-leader.html">Silverbolt</a> was previously attacking. Superion’s attack will be used to calculate damage.

          And to go one step further, as the Enigma is revealed by Anticipation Engine and not as part of the attack, is it correct you can’t take advantage of the green pip to send it to hand?
      
          <span><a class="source_link" href="https://www.tf-rules.info/roundups/wotc-roundups/Rules_Roundup-2019-06-28#Rules_Roundup-2019-06-28__628-6" title="Rules Roundup 2019-06-28">[Source: WotC]</a> <a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-06-28__628-6"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>

          If a card says reveal does it come into play or go back to the top. Example if I have Anticipation Engine and I reveal an upgrade does it stay in the play area until the end of turn, or go to the top of deck?

          With multiple Anticipation Engines and/or <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/metal-detector.html">Metal Detector</a>s, you handle the abilities one at a time. If you have an Anticipation Engine and a Metal Detector, you must specify which one you are using before revealing the card. If the card you reveal doesn’t match the type of card you’re looking for, it just stays on top of your deck. The next ability will reveal the same card, so choose wisely.

        <div class="answer">
          No. This all happens before Battle Cards are flipped.<br/>Speaking of which, what happens when a character upgraded with Anticipation Engine swings into a <a href="/wave-4/battle-cards/sabotaged-armaments.html">Sabotaged Armaments</a>?<br/>Anticipation Engine and Sabotaged Armaments will both trigger at the same time. The attacker will resolve Anticipation Engine first, then the defender will resolve Sabotaged Armaments.

          The opponent had an <a href="/wave-1/characters/optimus-prime-battlefield-legend.html">Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend</a> with an Anticipation Engine and attacked my Ramhorn. I had a <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/force-field.html">Force Field</a> in hand and was ready to play my white armor, when he flipped a <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/security-checkpoint.html">Security Checkpoint</a> with Anticipation Engine. Do I still get to play the Force Field in this situation or does the Checkpoint get rid of the Force Field before I play it?

        <div class="answer">
          Because attack triggers will resolve before defense triggers, in this scenario <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/security-checkpoint.html">Security Checkpoint</a> will get rid of your <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/force-field.html">Force Field</a> before you can play it.

          I have 2 untapped cars and a Wave 2 Bumblebee tapped in bot mode. I play Ready for Action untapping him. I then flip him, triggering his mode ability and I play <a href="/wave-6/battle-cards/all-out-attack.html">All-Out Attack</a> allowing all my character to attack this turn as they are now all untapped prior me playing All-Out Attack (AOA). I put Anticipation Engine on one of my characters. I then attack with Bee first (tapping him), my 2nd character (tapping him), and finally the last character with Anticipation Engine (AE) which then taps him. AE triggers and I get <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/start-your-engines.html">Start Your Engines</a> (SYE). I untap that last character with AE. Seeing how AOA was played during a time where all my characters were untapped, does that last character get to attack again since it was untapped with SYE post AOA being played?

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          If the opponent has no untapped characters, you will attack again with the last character. If the opponent has at least one untapped character, you cannot attack again with the last character. All Out Attack allows one attack with each of your untapped characters at the time you play it.

          In a situation where someone is using <a href="/wave-2/characters/thrust-supersonic-interceptor.html">Thrust</a> and an Anticipation Engine attached to a different bot, could that person use Thrust's ability multiple times if they flip a Ready for Action using the Anticipation Engine?

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <a href="/wave-2/characters/thrust-supersonic-interceptor.html">Thrust</a>’s ability only triggers once–when one of your other characters attacks. To use Thrust’s ability more than once, you need to untap Thrust and attack a second time with one of your other characters.
