      <question>
With Pop a Wheelie, the 2nd attack isn't from the same bot that attacked the turn the card was played, correct? I would need to have another untapped motorcycle make the 2nd attack?
</question>
      <answer>
Correct. If you have another untapped motorcycle on your team, you can attack again. However, note that the first attacker does not have to be a motorcycle.

            <question>
                Start Your Engines says "Flip each of your characters from bot mode to Car mode". Does this mean that you can target "Car mode" with Precision Fire? Is Car a mode?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. Car is a trait and not a mode. Despite this card using 'Car mode', you should consider it as a short hand for 'a mode with the Car trait'. The same is true for Hunker Down's use of Tank mode, and Pop a Wheelie's use of Motorcycle mode.
