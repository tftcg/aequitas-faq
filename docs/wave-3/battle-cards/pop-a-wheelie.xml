      <question>
With Pop a Wheelie, the 2nd attack isnâ€™t from the same bot that attacked the turn the card was played, correct? I would need to have another untapped motorcycle make the 2nd attack?
</question>
      <answer>
Correct. If you have another untapped motorcycle on your team, you can attack again. However, note that the first attacker does not have to be a motorcycle.
