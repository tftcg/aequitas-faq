      <question>
Hi, I just wondered if you can choose somebody that can't take non-attack damage as the recipient of non-attack damage, like if an opponent played Frag Toss and I had Motormaster in alt mode, would the damage have to go on Motormaster or could I choose somebody else and nullify it?

You can choose someone else to nullify it.
