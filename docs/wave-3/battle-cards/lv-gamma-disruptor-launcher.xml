      <question>
Say I have Major Shockwave with 2 LV Gamma-Disruptor Launchers, and I try to play a third copy onto him. Would the two already on him both scrap, or would only one?
      </question>
      <answer>
You would have to scrap only one of the two LV Gamma-Disruptos Launchers already on Major Shockwave.

      <question>
LV Gamma-Disruptor Launcher states that up to 2 of them can fit in one Weapon Slot. If I were to play a 3rd one, would it replace the 2 already in the Weapon Slot or would it only replace 1 of them?
</question>
      <answer>
It would only replace one of the previously equipped two.
