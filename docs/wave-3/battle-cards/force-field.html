      <div class="answer">
        The damage that would be done to the defender is instead done to the character with <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/heroism.html">Heroism</a> and Force Field. That damage is still attack damage, so 4 damage is done to the Upgraded character instead.

      <div class="answer">
        Because <a href="/wave-1/characters/megatron-decepticon-leader.html">Megatron</a> has Pierce 6, he would do 5 attack damage (remember that attack damage can’t be higher than the character’s attack, even with pierce).

        Force Field states "if the upgraded character would take 5 or more attack damage - instead scrap this card and the upgraded character takes 4 attack damage." What happens when the target received 4 or fewer attack damage?

        Okay, so you've stated in the past that your opponent's characters count as "cards" when referring to Motormaster rulings. I was wondering, with regards to <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/spare-parts.html">Spare Parts</a> (which scraps itself instead of another Upgrade attached to your character) and Force Field, would a character attack count as a card causing Force Field to discard? In other words, if your opponent attacked an upgraded character with both a Spare Parts and a Force Field with enough damage to trigger the Force Field's effect, would you scrap the Force Field or the Spare Parts?
        <span><a class="source_link" href="https://www.tf-rules.info/roundups/wotc-roundups/Rules_Roundup-2019-02-22" title="Rules Roundup 2019-02-22">[Source: WotC]</a> <a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-02-22__222-1"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        You would scrap Force Field because its ability is what causes it to be scrapped, not your opponent’s attack.

    <li id="Rules_Roundup-2019-04-12__412-6" class="faq_entry">
      
      <div class="question">
        <a name="Rules_Roundup-2019-04-12__412-6"/>
        Force Field states "If the upgraded character would take 5 or more attack damage - Instead scrap this card and the upgraded character takes 4 attack damage." If we follow the exact text of this and we have 2 Force Fields on the same character. If the upgraded character would take 5 or more attack damage both Force Fields would trigger, then they would take 8 attack damage (4 from each Force Field) This doesn't seem like the intended effect of Force Field but following the exact wording, isn't this what should happen?
        <span><a class="source_link" href="https://www.tf-rules.info/roundups/wotc-roundups/Rules_Roundup-2019-04-12" title="Rules Roundup 2019-04-12">[Source: WotC]</a> <a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-04-12__412-6"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. Force Field is a replacement effect, and only one of those applies at a given time. Once that happens, it reduces the initial attack damage to 4, which invalidates the second Force Field.

    <li id="Rules_Roundup-2019-04-12__412-8" class="faq_entry">
      
      <div class="question">
        <a name="Rules_Roundup-2019-04-12__412-8"/>
        If <a href="/wave-2/characters/dreadwing-sky-destroyer.html">Dreadwing</a> has two Force Fields equipped, wouldn't they both be scrapped at the same time? If a character would take 5 or more attack damage, both Force Fields would be triggered. Then you resolve them one at a time, in the order of your choice. The first one would scrap and reduce damage taken to 4. The second would scrap but the damage was already reduced to 4. This follows the Dinobot Sludge + <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/data-pad.html">Data Pad</a> ruling where both effects are triggered at attack, and even if Data Pad puts your hand equal to your opponent, you still resolve Sludge's ability to draw 2 cards. Correct?

        Does <a href="/wave-1/characters/grimlock-dinobot-leader.html">Grimlock</a>'s bot mode’s extra damage count as attack damage? If it does, and assuming Grimlock has 5 or more extra damage, how much damage does it do in the following situations:<br/>A. Damage is assigned to a bit with Force Field equipped.<br/>B. Damage is assigned to <a href="/wave-1/characters/insecticon-skrapnel-insecticon-leader.html">Insecticon Skrapnel</a> in bot mode.<br/>C. Any bot that is protected by <a href="/wave-2/characters/motormaster-stunticon-leader.html">Motormaster</a> alt mode skill.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The extra damage is not attack damage, so if you are redirecting to a bot-mode Skrapnel or a character with a force field on it, they will take the full additional damage. On the other hand, a damage-capping effect on the character you’re attacking will be relevant. So, if you have a Skrapnel in bot-mode with 5 damage on him and <a href="/wave-1/characters/grimlock-dinobot-leader.html">Grimlock</a> attacks him for say 10 damage, that damage will be reduced to 3 by Skrapnel’s ability, 2 of it will KO him, and the last point will be assigned to another character of the defending player’s choice.

        If two effects would apply to the same attack damage, the player receiving the damage chooses one to apply. Then, if the other still applies, apply that effect. If no other effects apply to the attack damage, the attack damage is finished.<br/>For example, if you have a character with a Force Field and <a href="/wave-2/characters/omega-supreme-autobot-defense-base.html">Omega Supreme</a>, and that character would take 6 attack damage, you could choose either of the following:<br/>1. Apply Force Field first, scrapping it and reducing the attack damage to 4, then use Omega Supreme’s ability to change the attack damage to: 2 to the other character and 2 to Omega Supreme.<br/>2. Apply Omega Supreme’s ability first, changing the attack damage to 4 to the other character and 2 to Omega Supreme. Force Field no longer applies and will stay on the other character.
