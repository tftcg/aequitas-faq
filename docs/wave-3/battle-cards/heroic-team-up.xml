      <question>If the Autobot I tap has any upgrades that increase its attack, do those bonuses count?</question>
      <answer>Yes. A character’s attack total equals its printed attack value plus any bonuses it’s getting from any other card.</answer>

      <question>
If I Attack with Alpha Trion or Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend and flip a Heroic Team-Up, can I use it to tap an untapped character of mine and have the Attack total added to Alpha Trion or Optimus? I would think so as the defense has yet to kick in and it is a playable action.

      <answer>
Heroic Team-Up can only increase the attack of an untapped Autobot. If Alpha Trion or OPBL attacked, it would be tapped by this point.
