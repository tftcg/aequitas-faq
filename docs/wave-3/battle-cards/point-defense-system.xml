      <question>If the upgraded character defends against an enemy that has pierce 1, what happens?</question>
      <answer>If a character’s pierce total is 0 or lower, treat that character as if it didn’t have pierce when determining how much damage is done. Pierce -1 doesn’t do anything weird.</answer>

      <question>
I believe I know the answer to this one, but asking for clarity purposes - I attack with 5 ATK/Pierce 7 onto a character with Point-Defense System. Does the final attack get reduced to ATK 5/Pierce 5 (which I believe is the correct answer) or ATK 5/Pierce 3?
        </question>
      <answer>
It would be reduced to 5 Attack, Pierce 5.
