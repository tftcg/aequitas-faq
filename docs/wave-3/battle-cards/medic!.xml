      <question>When do I use this ability?</question>
      <answer>You use it before the game begins. After you put the Medic! into your hand, you’ll shuffle the rest of your deck. Then you’ll draw the normal 3 cards at the start of the game. This means you’ll start the game with 4 cards in hand (Medic! plus the 3 you draw). You’ll still draw a card at the start of your first turn.</answer>
