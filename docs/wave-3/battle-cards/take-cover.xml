      <question>
I have a question concerning Heroism, the Wave 1 Utility. I have Heroism on a character and place the Take Cover! secret action during my turn. During my opponent's turn I reveal Take Cover!. When my opponent goes to attack and the attack damage is transferred to the character with Heroism what type of damage is this? Heroism is a tad vague on the damage that the character is taking. If its not attack damage I assume that Take Cover! could blank the attack effectively?
        </question>
      <answer>
Damage redirected by Heroism is still attack damage, so it is not affected by Take Cover.
