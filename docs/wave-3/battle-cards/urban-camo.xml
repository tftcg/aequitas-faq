      <question>
How many cards do I flip if my opponent shuffles their deck while attacking Omega Supreme (Spaceship)–triggering Combination–and I have Evasive Maneuvers on Omega Supreme (Spaceship) and Urban Camo on Omega Supreme (Base)?
        </question>
      <answer>
When you combine into Captain Omega Supreme, you get to keep 1 upgrade in each slot, so you can keep both Evasive Maneuvers and Urban Camo. You’ll flip a total of 6 Battle Cards. After the battle, you’ll scrap Evasive Maneuvers.
