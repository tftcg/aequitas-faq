      <question>
If I equipped Insecticon Skrapnel - Insecticon Leader with a card that is worth 1 star, would he then be considered a leader with 8 stars? Could I then use Callous Leadership on him?
      </question>
      <answer>
No and no. Stars on upgrade cards do not count towards the star counts of characters.

Callous Leadership says "move up to 5 damage counters from..." and I was asked if you can put an excess amount of damage on somebody i.e putting 5 on an Acid Storm who only has 4 health left, or can you only move four damage counters on him?
        </question>
      <answer>
Yes, you can move 5 damage to a character even if they have fewer than 5 health remaining.
