      <question>
If I start my turn with 3 Attack Drones and a Sparring Gear on General Megatron, does that count as 4 Upgrades (Meaning each Attack Drone counts, and therefore trigger his ability), or only 2, since only 2 slots are filled?
      </question>
      <answer>
Yes, each Attack Drone counts individually, so that is 4 upgrades, triggering General Megatronâ€™s bot mode ability.
