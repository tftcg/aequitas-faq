        <question>
          What happens at the start of my turn if I have three or less cards in my deck and Fangry is in bot mode?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Similar to Treasure Hunt, scrap the cards you have remaining according to instructions, shuffle all the other cards in your Scrap Pile (not including the ones you just scrapped) into your deck, then scrap any remaining cards from your deck, for a total of three.
