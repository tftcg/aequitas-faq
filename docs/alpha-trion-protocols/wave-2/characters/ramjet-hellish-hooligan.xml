            How does Ramjet’s can’t flip ability work? Can I flip him for my turn? Can I flip him with Rapid Conversion or Showing Off?
        </question>
        <answer>
    No, he can not be flipped as part of your ‘designated phases’ per turn NOR battle cards. The only way he can flip at any time is his own start of turn ability.

            For Ramjet’s bot mode defends ability, is that each battle? Does the damage get dealt before combat flips?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, the ability triggers each time Ramjet defends in a turn. However, the damage is only dealt after the attack finishes and attack damage is calculated. If there are multiple attackers, he will deal 1 damage to each at the end of each individual battle.
