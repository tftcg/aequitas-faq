        <question>
            Can I play this Silverbolt with the old Silverbolt on my starting team? His start of the game ability says I can’t put the original Silverbolt into my KO, but it doesn’t say anything about his teammates.

        <answer>
            Yes, you can, but you will not be able to combine if you have both because they represent the same piece for the Combiner. For example, you could have a 12/8/5 team consisting of both.

            Does the bot mode ability on Silverbolt still trigger while my opponent has an Autobot Jazz and Here’s the Thing in play?

        <answer>
            No, all Black pips would be considered as White and the Silverbolt, Air Commander ability would not be able to trigger due to lacking the minimum flipped icons requirement.
