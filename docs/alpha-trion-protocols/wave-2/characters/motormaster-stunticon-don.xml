        <question>
            Can I play this Motormaster with the old Motormaster on my starting team? His start of the game ability says I can’t put the original Motormaster into my KO, but it doesn’t say anything about his teammates.
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, you can, but you will not be able to combine if you have both because they represent the same piece for the Combiner. For example, you could have a 12/8/5 team consisting of both.

            Does the bot mode ability on Motormaster still trigger when my opponent reveals an End Hostilities?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, it would be unable to trigger cause your oranges would be blues so your attack will not meet the flipped icons requirement. Note: Your own Belligerence would also cause the ability to fail.
