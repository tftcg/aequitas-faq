        <question>
            Why can’t I bring Dirge back from my KO area?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Dirge has the ability to bring back a Blank card when KO’d, we did not want to create any “infinite loop” type scenario with the character due to cards like I Still Function and Involuntary Promotion.

            Dirge has the ability to bring back a Blank pip card, does that mean Action or Upgrade?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, any battle card that is Blank is a card you may bring back from the scrap pile.
