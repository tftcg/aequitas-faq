        <question>
            Can I put two of the same character into my KO area with Soundwave (i.e. Frenzy)?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, will be Covered in a Future Tournament Doc. The word “different” essentially means “a character that satisfies the requirements who is not already on your battlefield or in your KO area.” This is in reference to the character’s full name as well.

        <question>
            Soundwave only gets up to 3 ATK and 3 DEF; can I put a 4th bot into the KO with his bot mode attack trigger?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, for each time he attacks, you draw a card and then may add another Spy Patrol or Cassette to your KO, as long as it satisfies the “different” definition in the question above.
