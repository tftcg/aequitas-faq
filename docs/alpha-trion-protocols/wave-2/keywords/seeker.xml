        <question>
            What does the Seeker tag mean? Why is it on them? Is it referenced anywhere outside these characters in the set?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Seeker is a new Trait created for ATP-2, as well as potential future design space to create additional Seeker characters or abilities/cards that key off of the trait.  There are only three characters in the set with the Trait, and zero battle cards that reference the new Trait (currently).  Note: Any older characters that are traditionally considered “Seekers” in Lore are NOT Seekers for this Trait’s purposes..for now..
