            Does this get the trigger against Sky Shadow’s combined form?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, Skyshadow is 17 Stars (14 for the body, 3 for Ominus) and this would trigger against him. Head mode stars are added to alt/body mode stars for ‘multi-component’ characters like Titan Masters per the WotC ruling.

        <question>
            What happens if I get the trigger, but my opponent reveals a Sabotaged Armaments?
        </question>
        <answer>
            The Trigger grants the ability to the Character; therefore you would keep +2 Attack and Pierce 2 for that Battle, similar to cards like Kinetic Intensifier Whip.
