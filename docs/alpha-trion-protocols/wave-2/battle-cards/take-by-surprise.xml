        <question>
            Does this “scrap” the Upgrade that moves to the top of the deck?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, this is a new way of interacting with Upgrades. Similar to returning an upgrade to a player’s hand, instead it is placed on the top of their battle deck. Abilities that prevent the Scrapping of an upgrade will not work on Take by Surprise (similar to Disarm).
