        <question>
            Can I put an Ionizer Sword on one of my Stunticons before I combine?
        </question>
        <answer>
    Yes, but you will only gain the +3 attack. Only Menasor is granted the draw on attack flip ability.
    2. What types of battle Icons are those?
            They are faction stamped icons for Stunticons. Therefore only when a Stunticon is battling can you gain benefit from the Orange or Blue icon (s). It will still count as both colors for abilities that check if you flip a certain type or number of colors.
