        <question>
            Does Spotlights work for my whole team? Or for my opponent’s whole team?
        </question>
        <answer>
            While Spotlights is attached to a character on your team, it removes all Stealth from all enemies, which grants each of your characters the ability to attack whomever they wish (aside from Brave, which is unaffected by this card). You cannot “regain Stealth,” if you had more than one instance of it either, it is a binary ability.
