        <question>
            If I have a Scoundrelâ€™s Blaster AND a Terrifying Resilience (more than one Decepticon Upgrade) on my Megatron, does he get +2 ATK and DEF?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No, it only counts the first Decepticon upgrade for the ability.

        <question>
            When players scrap cards from the top of their deck for this ability, can they swap for Green pip cards?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No. You may only swap for a Green icon card after battle flips resolve. Flipping and scrapping are different actions in-game.
