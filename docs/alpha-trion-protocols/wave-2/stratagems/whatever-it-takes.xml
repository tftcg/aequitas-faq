            What does it mean that “my deck can have up to 1 extra STAR of cards?” Does that mean characters or battle cards?

        <answer>
            Your Battle deck may include 1 Star card and still be considered a Legal Deck. Examples include Mounted Missiles, Energized Field, Leap of Faith, etc.

        <question>
            What types of battle Icons are those?
        </question>
        <answer>
            They are faction stamped icons for Aerialbots, therefore only when an Aerialbot is battling can you gain benefit from the Blue or White icon(s). It will still count as both colors for abilities that check if you flip a certain type or number of colors.
