        <question>
          If I have a Leader on my team, who can I give the +3 ATK to?
        </question>
        <answer>
          You can only give one of your Leader characters the +3 ATK. If you have multiple Leaders, you can choose between them to receive this bonus.

        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes. You would only get the second ability then, as long as you have a Ranged character.
