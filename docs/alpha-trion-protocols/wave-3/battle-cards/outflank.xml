        <question>
          What happens if I choose an enemy Specialist that is wearing Holomatter Projector or Defense Driving or has Sturdy?
        </question>
        <answer>
          The ability on the card will only cause someone to draw if a Specialist is damaged this way. Cards or abilities preventing or reducing damage to 0 will not result in the character’s owner drawing a card.
