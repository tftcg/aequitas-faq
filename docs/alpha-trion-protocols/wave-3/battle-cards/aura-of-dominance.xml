          Can I play this on a character with less than 11 stars?  
        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes, you will simply not gain the second ability. The character will still gain Bold 1, Tough 1 and 2 extra HP.

          What happens if I play this on an 11*+ character and my opponent has a card disabling my cards from scrapping Upgrades on their characters?
        </question>
        <answer>
          They will still scrap a card from their hand, but will not have to scrap an Upgrade.
