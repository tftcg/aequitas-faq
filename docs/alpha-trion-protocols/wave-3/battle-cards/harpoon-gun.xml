          Can I put this on Decepticons?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes, just because it is an Autobot card doesn’t mean that restricts who you can play it on. Take Energon Mace as an inverse example.

          What happens when I attack with this on a character who is a Leader, but isn’t a Wrecker?

        <question>
          Does my character keep the bonuses from the “attacks” triggers if my opponent reveals a Sabotaged Armaments?
        </question>
        <answer>
          You would keep the bonus ATK from the second and third abilities, if applicable. However, you would lose the Weapon’s static +1 ATK, Bold 1, and Pierce 1 that it normally gives.
