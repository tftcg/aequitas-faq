        <question>
          Can I still play the Omega Supreme parts with Heroic Spotlight and Unbreachable?  
        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes, each Stratagem has its own conditions that playing all three constituent parts of Captain Omega Supreme together still satisfies, and the two Stratagems do not have the same named condition.

          Can I play Unbreachable with only Omega Supreme (Base) without the other parts?  
        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes, you will just not have the ability to flip Unbreachable because you wonâ€™t be able to combine.

        <question>
          Once the Stratagem flips, will Capt. Omega Supreme still be Brave and Sturdy?
        </question>
        <answer>
          No, just like characters, only the active (read: face-up) side of Stratagems is applied. Plus, that ability on the front side of Unbreachable specifically applies to a character with another name.
