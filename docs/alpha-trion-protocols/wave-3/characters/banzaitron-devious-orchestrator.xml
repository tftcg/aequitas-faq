        <question>
          Does Banzaitron’s flip-to-Alt ability work with Hunker Down?
        </question>
        <answer>
          If you put an Armor on him with Hunker Down, and it doesn’t scrap before you have resolved his flip-to-Alt ability, you will get to do the effect because the “if Armor” clause isn’t until after the arrow.
