        <question>
          If I started with him and 1 other Car on my team, but I flip the other Car to a mode where it doesn’t have that trait anymore, does he have Bold 2 now?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes. Characters only have the traits of their active (read: face-up) side, and Wheeljack’s first Alt mode ability uses “while”, which means it is constantly checking to see your other characters’ traits.

        <question>
          When I use his flip-to-Alt ability, do I have to do one damage to one of my Wreckers?
        </question>
        <answer>
          No, you do not. The “may” makes this an optional ability.

        <question>
          When I use his flip-to-Alt ability, can I do 1 damage to one of my Wreckers and NOT play the card?
        </question>
        <answer>
          No, once you opt into doing the damage to one of your Wreckers, you MUST play the card scrapped to this ability.
