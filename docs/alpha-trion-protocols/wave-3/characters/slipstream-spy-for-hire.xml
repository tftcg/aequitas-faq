          What if my opponent has no cards in hand and I flip-to-Alt mode?   
        </question>
        <answer>
          Each of your Decepticons will get +1 attack as there is no card to discard with more than one icon, so the “Otherwise” ability will work the same as if you revealed a card with two or more pips to the ability.
