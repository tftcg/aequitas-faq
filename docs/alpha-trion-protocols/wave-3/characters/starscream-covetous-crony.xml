          Add the blank to your hand, and scrap the other two. Then, give one of your Planes or Seekers Bold 1--two separate times.

        <question>
          When he’s in Bot mode, and a Seeker of mine attacks and flips 2 blank-pip cards, do I trigger the second ability twice or just once?
        </question>
        <answer>
          You only trigger it once because the condition is “at least one [blank-pip card].” It doesn’t matter if you flip 1 or 60 blank-pips; the ability will only trigger once on each attack.
