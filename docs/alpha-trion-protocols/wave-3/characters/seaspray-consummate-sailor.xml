        <question>
          Seaspray’s bot ability says “each character.” Does that work if I have two 9-stars with Seaspray in Bot mode?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Each of your 9-stars would get the +1 ATK in this case.

        <question>
          What happens when my highest star character gets KO’d?
        </question>
        <answer>
          The Bot mode ability is always checking, so the next highest star character or characters would now receive the bonus. If Seaspray is your character with the most stars, he will give himself the bonus.
