          Can I return one of my own Upgrades to hand with Highbrow’s flip-to-Alt ability?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Yes. Note this ability is not a “may” ability; you must do it if you flip.

        <question>
          Highbrow’s bot ability says “each character.” Does that work if I have two 9-stars with Highbrow in Bot mode?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Each of your 9-stars would get the +1 DEF in this case.

        <question>
          What happens when my highest star character gets KO’d?
        </question>
        <answer>
          The Bot mode ability is always checking, so the next highest star character or characters would now receive the bonus. If Highbrow is your character with the most stars, he will give himself the bonus.
