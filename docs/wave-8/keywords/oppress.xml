        <answer>
            Oppress is a keyword ability introduced in Wave 8. While the character with Oppress is battling, ALL characters Bold and Tough totals are reduced by the Oppress value. Unless introduced within a battle, this effect is turned on instantaneously when the character is chosen to attack or defend, and remains in play until the Post-Attack subphase begins.
