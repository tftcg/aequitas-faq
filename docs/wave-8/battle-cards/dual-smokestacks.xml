        <question>
            Dual Smokestacks says that my opponent chooses to "Do 1 damage to each enemy" or "Do 2 damage to an enemy of your choice". The enemy of my enemy is myself, so does this mean that Dual Smokestacks does damage to my characters?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No. Your opponent is choosing which operation you will perform. Your opponent's characters will be the ones that have damage done to them.
