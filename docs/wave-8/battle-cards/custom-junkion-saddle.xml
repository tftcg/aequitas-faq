        <answer>
            Just like characters with stations already on them, a character cannot take the Junkion Saddle station on another character that has been upgraded with Custom Junkion Saddle unless the upgraded character is tapped. You can tap the Custom Junkion Saddle when the character upgraded with it is tapped to help you remember.
