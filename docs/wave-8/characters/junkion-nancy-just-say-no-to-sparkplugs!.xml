        <question>
            With Junkion Nancy's station ability, if I focus and then scrap a card, is that +2 defence?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No. Focus includes the act of scrapping, so Nancy only provides +1 defence to the stationed character.

            Is Junkion Nancy's station ability affected by Aerial Recon?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes, but only as long as you decide to scrap the card that Aerial Recon reveals.

        <question>
            If my character stationed on Junkion Nancy has Focus 3, do I get +3 defence?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No. Focus stacks into a single event, so on defending, a character with Focus 3 would use Focus only once per each defence.
