      <question>
My question is in regard to Wave 1 Kickback and Demolisher. If the ability states to flip two extra battlecards for each other Insecticon you started the game with, or flip extra battle cards equal to your defense, and you don’t flip a white on your initial two flips, does a white battle icon flipped during those extra flips cause you to flip two extra cards?

      <answer>
It doesn’t matter when the white icon is flipped. The first time it’s flipped, it will use its ability.
