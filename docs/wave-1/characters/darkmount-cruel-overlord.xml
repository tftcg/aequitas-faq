      <question>
If I play Hunker Down and flip Darkmount to tank mode can I then choose to activate to Darkmount's ability to discard a card from my hand before equipping an armor?
</question>
      <answer>
No, you must finish resolving Hunker Down before any triggered abilities from character flips are resolved.
