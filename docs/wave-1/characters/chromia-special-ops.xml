      <question>
    Let’s say I reveal one white battle icon during Chromia’s attack. Then I flip another white battle icon
in the two bonus cards. Will her ability trigger?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. For any ability that looks at what battle icons you flipped, flip your two bonus cards before
checking if that ability triggers or not.

      <question>
While playing Chromia, you trigger her ability by flipping 2 white icons for your first 2 battle card flips, is that when your draw into hand happens? Or do you continue your battle flips then take your draw into hand?
      </question>
      <answer>
Resolve all of the flips and then draw into your hand.
