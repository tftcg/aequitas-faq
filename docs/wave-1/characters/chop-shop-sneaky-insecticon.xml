      <question>
    If the Upgrade I move onto Chop Shop has an ability that triggers "when the Upgraded character
attacks," does that ability trigger?
</question>
      <answer>
    No. That Upgrade wasn’t on Chop Shop when he attacked, so that ability won’t trigger.

      <question>
    If the Upgrade I move onto Chop Shop gives him Bold or an ability to flip extra battle cards when
attacking, do I flip extra battle cards?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. Chop Shop’s ability happens before you flip battle cards, so Upgrades that give Chop Shop Bold
will work.

      <question>
    Can Chop Shop’s ability be used to move an Upgrade that says "Put only on Planes" onto him?
</question>
      <answer>
    No. Any ability that says what an Upgrade can be put on still apply, so you can’t sneak Upgrades onto
Chop Shop that he can’t have.

      <question>
Please clarify the interaction between Thrust and Chop Shop under the following scenario:
    Chop Shop flips to bot-mode
    Equip a Grenade Launcher onto Thrust
    Chop Shop attacks
    Thrust and Chop Shop's abilities trigger at the same time, so order of resolution is up to the turn-player
    1) Resolve Thrust's ability and tap him to add 7 atk (base + Grenade Launcher) to Chop Shop
    2) Resolve Chop Shop's ability moving the Grenade Launcher from Thrust to Chop Shop
    Chop Shop's final attack is [BASE] + [GRENADE_LAUNCHER] + [THRUST_BASE] + [GRENADE_LAUNCHER]; 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15
    Battle flips omitted
Is this correct?
        </question>
      <answer>
You can choose to resolve Thrust and Chop Shop’s abilities in this order. You could also choose to resolve them in the other order, but that would probably not turn out as well for you, so maybe don’t.

      <question>
At what point does the upgrade I chose to move to Chop Shop take effect? During the attack so I gain the possible effect for my current attack, or does the cards effect (additional attack, additional bold, etc.) not happen until the next time I attack with Chop Shop?
      </question>
      <answer>
You would get the benefits of the upgrade immediately, with the exception of abilities that trigger from Chop Shop attacking, because that event would have already passed (i.e. Data Pad).
