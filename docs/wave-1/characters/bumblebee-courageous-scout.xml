      <question>
    What happens if I have no cards in my hand when I use this ability?
</question>
      <answer>
    You’ll draw a card, look at it, and immediately put it on top of your deck. You can’t do anything else
with the card (like play it) before putting it on top of your deck.

      <question>
    Let’s say I reveal one white battle icon during Bumblebee’s combat. Then I flip another white battle
icon in the two bonus cards. Will his ability trigger?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. For any ability that looks at what battle icons you flipped, flip your two bonus cards before
checking if that ability triggers or not.

      <question>
Wheeljack is in car mode is equipped with the following: 
Multi-Tool, Turbo Boosters, and Scrapper Gauntlets.
Bumblebee - Courageous Scout is tapped, in car mode, and equipped with the following:
Drill Arms, Crushing Size, and Multi Mission Gear.
For my action, I play Swap Parts between Wheeljack and Bumblebee. There are a LOT of abilities that fire off here and I'm curious to know, what would be the appropriate order? Most importantly, when does Wheeljack's ability take priority?
      </question>
      <answer>
These would all trigger at the same, so you would choose the order they happen in.
