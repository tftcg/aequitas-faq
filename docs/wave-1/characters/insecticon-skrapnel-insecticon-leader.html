        Let’s say Insecticon Skrapnel defends and the attacker has an ability that deals damage to him. Does<br/>that damage count for Insecticon Skrapnel’s ability?

        Yes. Any damage dealt to Insecticon Skrapnel while he’s defending will count. If the attacker has an<br/>ability that deals 1 damage to Insecticon Skrpanel, then he can’t take more than 2 more damage from<br/>the attack.

        Is <a href="/keywords/pierce.html">Pierce</a> damage still considered attack damage? For example, if someone is attacking me with Pierce 4 against a character like Insecticon Skrapnel whose text is “can’t take more than 3 damage during an attack”, does that mean even though they have Pierce 4 after adding attack damage, would they only do 3, or would they do 4?

        My opponent has <a href="/wave-1/characters/wheeljack-weapons-inventor.html">Wheeljack</a> untapped and I have Skrapnel untapped. It's my turn and I flip Skrapnel to alt mode, then play <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/i-still-function!.html">I Still Function!</a> to bring back <a href="/wave-1/characters/ransack-insecticon-commando.html">Ransack</a> in bot mode from the KO area. Then I attack with Ransack to Wheeljack, and after the flip of battle cards, Ransack is KO’d. Does Skrapnel’s ability trigger because of Ransack getting KO’d and make Wheeljack tap, letting me attack with Skrapnel?

      <div class="answer">
        You can do either, but not both. If you want to tap a character using Skrapnel’s flip trigger, you must KO <a href="/wave-1/characters/ransack-insecticon-commando.html">Ransack</a> before he can attack. If you want to attack with Ransack, it will be too late to flip Skrapnel to utilize his flip trigger.

        In the FAQ for Skrapnel it states, "Any damage dealt to Insecticon Skrapnel while he's defending will count. If the attacker has an ability that deals 1 damage to Insecticon Skrapnel, then he can't take more than 2 more damage from the attack." However, in a Rules Roundup (2/18 for reference) it was said, "Attack Damage is damage dealt by the attacking character as a result of an attack. Any other damage, including damage dealt during an attack because of an ability is non-attack damage." Is Skrapnel's FAQ incorrect or am I missing something?

        Does <a href="/wave-1/characters/grimlock-dinobot-leader.html">Grimlock</a>'s bot mode’s extra damage count as attack damage? If it does, and assuming Grimlock has 5 or more extra damage, how much damage does it do in the following situations:<br/>A. Damage is assigned to a bit with <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/force-field.html">Force Field</a> equipped.<br/>B. Damage is assigned to Insecticon Skrapnel in bot mode.<br/>C. Any bot that is protected by <a href="/wave-2/characters/motormaster-stunticon-leader.html">Motormaster</a> alt mode skill.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The extra damage is not attack damage, so if you are redirecting to a bot-mode Skrapnel or a character with a force field on it, they will take the full additional damage. On the other hand, a damage-capping effect on the character you’re attacking will be relevant. So, if you have a Skrapnel in bot-mode with 5 damage on him and <a href="/wave-1/characters/grimlock-dinobot-leader.html">Grimlock</a> attacks him for say 10 damage, that damage will be reduced to 3 by Skrapnel’s ability, 2 of it will KO him, and the last point will be assigned to another character of the defending player’s choice.

        Can you also go into more depth about the rulings for <a href="/wave-1/characters/megatron-living-weapon.html">Megatron - Living Weapon</a> and Insecticon Skrapnel? I found it very confusing that MLW can swap a Weapon in his Armor Slot via <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/swap-parts.html">Swap Parts</a> and that Skrapnel treats <a href="/wave-1/characters/metroplex-autobot-city.html">Metroplex</a>'s 1 Damage to all Opponents as Attack Damage.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The Skrapnel ruling has been corrected. The 1 damage to all opponents is not attack damage. The <a href="/wave-1/characters/megatron-living-weapon.html">Megatron</a> question is a little ambiguous. If you play Swap parts on a Megatron with a weapon in his armor slot, you can move it to another character and put it into their weapon slot. If Megatron had two weapons, you would have to choose which one the other character kept. If you are swapping a weapon from the other character to Megatron in bot mode, you can put it into any of his slots. If you are swapping a weapon and armor from another character to Megatron, Living Weapon in bot-mode, the legal assignments are (Weapon in the weapon slot, armor in the armor slot; Weapon in the utility slot, armor in the armor slot; weapon in the armor slot, armor also in the armor slot, then one of them gets scrapped).
