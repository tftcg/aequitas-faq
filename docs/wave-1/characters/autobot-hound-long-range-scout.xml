      <question>
    Let’s say you attack with another character and flip a white battle icon. Then, because your
opponent’s characters are all tapped, you get to attack again. For your second attack, you attack with
Autobot Hound and flip a white battle icon. Will his ability trigger?
</question>
      <answer>
    No. The white battle icon you flipped while attacking with Autobot Hound wasn’t your first white
battle icon that turn, so he won’t get the bonus.

      <question>
Had an interesting situation occur last night. Had Thundercracker on defense with 4 health remaining equipped with a Crash Landing. Autobot Hound was attacking who only had 2 health remaining. Hound had enough attack power after flipping to take out Thundercracker. Both were the last bots on each side, would Crash Landing still go off, creating a Draw?
      </question>
      <answer>
Hound will KO Thundercracker and win the game before Thundercracker can Crash Land and KO Hound.
