      <question>
    What happens if one of my characters that’s a Car while in alt mode but not in bot mode is KO’d
while it’s in bot mode?
</question>
      <answer>
    Characters are put in the KO area in the same mode they were in on the battlefield. In that case, the
KO’d character isn’t a Car and won’t add to Cliffjumper’s bonus.

Does transforming a Car-mode character in the KO pile activate Cliffjumper's alternate mode ability?
      </question>
      <answer>
Not unless specifically stated. K.O.’d characters flipping wont trigger any abilities unless otherwise stated.

      <question>
Say I have Autobot Hot Rod (Sentinel) in the KO area and Cliffjumper in play in alt mode. When I flip Hot Rod in the KO area to bot mode, does it trigger Cliffjumper’s ability to draw a card? Since Cliffjumper’s ability doesn’t stipulate the Car has to be in play, it would seem like this would be valid, right?
      </question>
      <answer>
No. Card abilities do not affect and are not affected by cards in the KO area unless specifically stated on the card.

      <question>
If I flip Sunstreaker in KO area to alt mode to draw a card, would that still trigger Cliffjumper’s alt mode skill to draw a card?
      </question>
      <answer>
No. Abilities only look at things on the battlefield unless specifically stated.
