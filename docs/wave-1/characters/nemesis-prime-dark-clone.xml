      <question>
If I have Major Ultra Magnus with 16 Damage on him and my opponent has Nemesis Prime with 15 Damage on him and I Attack Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend, causing my bot mode skill to trigger, does this cause Major Ultra Magnus to be KO’d and Nemesis Prime to be KO’d therefore no combat with Optimus?
      </question>
      <answer>
That is correct.

      <question>
If I'm attacking with Nemesis Prime and in the course of my attack burn through my deck, his ability triggers and I shuffle. Once done shuffling, the bottom card goes under him. Does he instantly get the +3 attack, or does it get added to his next attack?
      </question>
      <answer>
He gets the +3 attack instantly.

      <question>
Does Nemesis Prime keep his attack power from recycling scrap when he transforms to truck mode?
      </question>
      <answer>
The ability that grants the attack bonus is not on his truck mode, so it does not increase his attack, although the face-down cards remain under him.

      <question>
If I have Shockwave in play and my opponent has 2 characters with 1 damage left each (say Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend with 13 damage and Nemesis Prime with 15 damage) and I play System Reboot forcing them to discard 2 cards, can they choose to put both damage on Nemesis Prime or must they put 1 damage on each?
      </question>
      <answer>
Each card discarded creates a new instance of 1 damage, so they will be forced to put one damage on each.
