      <question>
    Are the flipped battle cards put into the scrap pile?
</question>
      <answer>
    Not right away. Set them aside for now, in the same place you put played Actions cards and battle cards flipped during the attack. Those cards will all be scrapped at the end of the turn.

      <question>
Are cards flipped during battle the only ones that don't hit the Scrap Pile until the end of a turn?
      </question>
      <answer>
Actions that are played (including Secret Actions), cards you flipped during battle, and other cards you flip due to cards like Swarm!, for example, are all scrapped at the end of turn.
