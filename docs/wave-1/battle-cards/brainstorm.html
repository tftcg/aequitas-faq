          You use it before the game begins. After you put the Brainstorm into your hand, you’ll shuffle the rest of your deck. Then you’ll draw the normal 3 cards at the start of the game. This means you’ll start the game with 4 cards in hand (Brainstorm plus the 3 you draw). You’ll still draw a card at the start of your first turn.

          First, choose your first Action. Carry out all its instructions and set it aside. Then choose your second Action and carry out its instructions. Note that you don’t have to choose the Actions ahead of time. For example, if your first Action lets you draw a card, and that card is an Action, you could play that Action as your second one.

          This was written in Rules Roundup 10/11/19:<br/>“I play Brainstorm. Using my 2 actions, I play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/ancient-wisdom.html">Ancient Wisdom</a> first, then <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/system-reboot.html">System Reboot</a>. I draw <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/unleash-potential.html">Unleash Potential</a> off of System Reboot, do I get to play it for free now?<br/>Both Brainstorm and Ancient Wisdom resolve “top to bottom”. When you play Brainstorm, then you play Ancient Wisdom, you must play Unleash Potential at that moment. In your case, you’ve moved past Ancient Wisdom and are continuing with Brainstorm, playing System Reboot. It’s now too late to play Unleash Potential with your previous Ancient Wisdom.”<br/>Would this rule also apply to <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/tech-research.html">Tech Research</a>? You must play a Superior upgrade after playing Tech Research or else that Tech Research is not forfeit. Example: I play Brainstorm first, then I play Tech Research, then I play Medic. Can I play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/superior-jetpack.html">Superior Jetpack</a>?

          Superior upgrades only check to see if you have played <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/tech-research.html">Tech Research</a> at some point previously in your turn. Therefore, there is no issue with playing other cards between Tech Research and a Superior upgrade.

          How does Brainstorm work, exactly? Do I play the two actions from my hand immediately, then resolve them, or do I resolve the first action before playing and resolving the second action? What if a character's trigger happens between actions, such as Wave 1 <a href="/wave-1/characters/thundercracker-mach-warrior.html">Thundercracker</a>? Are triggers resolved before or after the action that triggers them?

          I have a team of all Autobots, including <a href="/wave-3/characters/captain-wheeljack-engineering-scientist.html">Captain Wheeljack</a> in bot mode. I play Brainstorm, and as the first action, play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/confidence.html">Confidence</a>. Do I play my second action for Brainstorm now, or do I resolve Confidence first and play an action via Confidence?

Do I draw the card for that immediately, or do I wait until all the actions played via Confidence and Brainstorm have resolved?

          In your first scenario, <a href="/wave-2/characters/volcanicus-fiery-champion.html">Volcanicus</a> appears on the battlefield with 55 damage counters on him. <br/>In your second scenario, you can <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/i-still-function!.html">I Still Function!</a> one of the five Dinobots and then use the Dinobot Engima to form Volcanicus. Volcanicus will have 54 damage counters on him (because of the 1 damage ISF! repairs).

          It can refer to your sideboard, however your “outside the game” cards do not have to be in your sideboard to be considered detectable by the game.<br/>In resolving the Brainstorm, you will play both <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/defensive-formation.html">Defensive Formation</a>s.

Hunker Down flips all 3 to alt mode, then I play armors from the scrap pile if able. Once Hunker Down is complete, I play Rapid Conversion targeting Megatron to flip him into bot mode. Brainstorm is now resolved. Moving on to character triggers, would Demolisher’s ability now draw 1 or 2 cards? Would I be allowed to use Megatron’s flip ability?

          Shockwave’s ability will trigger a total of 8 times. Each of those abilities resolves separately, so essentially you have 8 damage counters to spread around as you wish.

        <div class="answer">
          Here's what happens. Your opponent starts to play Brainstorm, this causes <a href="/wave-4/characters/nightbird-enigmatic-agent.html">Nightbird</a>’s ability to trigger, but that effect doesn’t resolve immediately. Continuing to resolve Brainstorm, your opponent then plays <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/system-reboot.html">System Reboot</a>. Another Nightbird trigger happens, which, again, doesn’t resolve immediately. The System Reboot resolves, causing Shockwave to trigger four times. Continuing to resolve Brain Storm, your opponent then plays the second System Reboot. This causes another Nightbird trigger. The second System Reboot causes another four Shockwave triggers. Now that Brainstorm has resolved, we start resolving triggers, beginning with the ones that triggered most recently and working backwards. The four Shockwave triggers caused by the second System Reboot happen one at a time. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the second System Reboot happens. Next, the Shockwave triggers caused by the first System Reboot happens. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the first System Reboot happens. And finally, the Nightbird trigger caused by the Brain Storm happens. At any point, if resolving one of these triggers causes a player to KO their last character, that player loses the game. If Shockwave was at 3 and Nightbird was at 8 at the beginning of this sequence, Nightbird is going to lose.

        <div class="answer">
          Let’s walk through this whole play. You play Brainstorm and your first action is <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/ancient-wisdom.html">Ancient Wisdom</a>. Ancient Wisdom has you scrap the top two cards of your deck and put an Action and/or Upgrade from among the scrapped cards into your hand. At this point, you can play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/unleash-potential.html">Unleash Potential</a>, if it’s in your hand.<br/>Let’s say you do. You get a card with 1 star from outside the game and put it into your hand. This may not be a great idea, because you then play the second action from Brainstorm, which is <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/system-reboot.html">System Reboot</a>. You scrap your hand (including that fancy star card you just snagged) and draw 4 cards.<br/>But instead, let’s say you don’t play Unleash Potential. That brings you to the end of Ancient Wisdom and now you System Reboot just as above.<br/>In either case, your new hand is <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/multi-mission-gear.html">Multi-Mission Gear</a>, Brainstorm, and 2 Unleash Potentials. You’ve already played an Action this turn, so we’re guessing you’ll now play Multi-Mission Gear. This allows you to play an Action such as Brainstorm. Brainstorm will allow you to play 2 Unleash Potentials. You played Ancient Wisdom earlier in your turn, so you can get two 1-star cards from outside the game.

          Let's say you have a team of combiners. And your opponent’s characters are all tapped out. You have one character untapped and all of your characters are in bot mode. I know you can’t use <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/inferno-breath.html">Inferno Breath</a> in this instance because you wouldn’t be able to attack to end the turn. However, if you play Brainstorm and then play Inferno Breath, tapping your last character and then using the Brainstorm’s second effect to play and enigma and combine, is that a legal play?

        <div class="answer">
          In this scenario, you actually could play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/inferno-breath.html">Inferno Breath</a> because you can tap your last character. When it comes time to attack, if you have no untapped characters, your turn would end. If your opponent also has no untapped character, you would untap all characters as usual and your opponent’s turn would begin. If you play the enigma and combine your characters into a <a href="/keywords/combiner.html">Combiner</a>, the Combiner begins untapped, so it would be the character that attacks.

          Would playing multiple instances of <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/steamroll.html">Steamroll</a> in the same turn allow for damage, if it were high enough to KO the second character as well as the initial character that was knocked out, to carry over to a second or third target?

          Does the <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/i-still-function!.html">I Still Function!</a> + <a href="/wave-2/characters/dreadwing-sky-destroyer.html">Dreadwing</a> rule apply generally to <a href="/keywords/combiner.html">Combiner</a>s or is it specific to Dreadwing’s method of Combination? Suppose I control <a href="/wave-1/characters/dinobot-sludge-mighty-stomper.html">Dinobot Sludge - Mighty Stomper</a> and have the five Dinobot components in my <a href="/keywords/ko.html">KO</a> Area. Can I Brainstorm+ I Still Function! + <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/dinobot-enigma.html">Dinobot Enigma</a> and expect to keep <a href="/wave-2/characters/volcanicus-fiery-champion.html">Volcanicus</a> at the end of the turn?

        <div class="answer">
          The same ruling applies. If you <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/i-still-function!.html">I Still Function!</a> One of the Dinobots and then play <a href="/wave-2/battle-cards/dinobot-enigma.html">Dinobot Enigma</a>, at the end of your turn, <a href="/wave-2/characters/volcanicus-fiery-champion.html">Volcanicus</a> will be <a href="/keywords/ko.html">KO</a>’d.

          I am playing Nightbird in alt mode. My opponent plays Brainstorm and 2 follow-up actions. I reveal a Secret Action to stop 1 of the follow-ups. Does my opponent still take 3 damage?

        <div class="answer">
          Yes. Even when cancelled by an action such as <a href="/wave-3/battle-cards/infiltrate.html">Infiltrate</a>, <a href="/wave-4/battle-cards/jam-signals.html">Jam Signals</a>, or <a href="/wave-5/battle-cards/overrule.html">Overrule</a>, a card is still played and an effects that refer to cards, or number of cards, being played still occur. Another example would be Thundercracker, Mach Warrior's bot mode effect.
