      <question>
In a previous round up you mentioned that if Ion Blaster of Optimus Prime was played on Optimus, then he was combined into Optimus Maximus, the Combiner could keep that weapon, however not if he was already formed. Iâ€™m assuming that also works with Laser Cutlass? Play onto an Aerialbot for example. Once combined, does it carry over?

      <question>
Can I play Ion Blaster of Optimus Prime on General Optimus Prime? Ion Blaster says "Play on Optimus Prime only", so would the word "General" in his name disallow it?
</question>
      <answer>
Just because he's a General doesn't mean he's any less Prime! You may indeed play Ion Blaster on General Prime.

      <question>
Since Ironhide and Optimus Prime are both components of Optimus Maximus in Wave 2, how do their unique weapons from Wave 1 interact with the Combiner? Will Optimus Maximus take damage from Static Laser of Ironhide? Can I play Ion Blaster of Optimus Prime on a combined Optimus Maximus?
      </question>
      <answer>
Optimus Maximus would take the damage from Static Laser of Ironhide, as he is not named Ironhide. You can keep Ion Blaster of Optimus Prime if you already had one upgraded to Optimus Prime - Gleaming Commander, but you could not put one onto Optimus Maximus.
