      <question>
    Do I draw a card before doing the other parts of the effect?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. If a card tells you to do multiple things, always do them in order. First, you’ll draw a card. Then you scrap an enemy Upgrade. Finally, your opponent scraps a card from their hand. (This means they’ll know what Upgrade you scrap before deciding what card to scrap from their hand.)
