      <question>
    Can I put this on characters other than Ironhide?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. Those characters will get the +3 attack bonus, but they will be damaged by Static Laser of Ironhide’s ability when they attack. If the Upgraded character is Ironhide, that ability won’t do anything and Ironhide can attack without being damaged.

      <question>
If I have Captain Ironhide with Static Laser of Ironhide in the weapon slot and Mounted Missiles in the armor slot, and I attack with Captain Ironhide in bot mode, can I swap the Mounted Missiles with a blue pip weapon and it still be in the armor slot?
      </question>
      <answer>
No. Unless either the weapon or the character states that the weapon can be in the armor slot, it can’t. So in this scenario, you would not be able to swap one weapon for another weapon from the armor slot However, you could swap Mounted Missiles for a blue weapon and put that weapon in the weapon slot, which would scrap the Static Laser of Ironhide.

      <question>
If I have Static Laser of Ironhide equipped to Ironhide when I combine the Sentinels into Optimus Maximus, and keep it, does he take the damage penalty, or does he count as Ironhide since Ironhide is part of him?
      </question>
      <answer>
Optimus Maximus is not Ironhide, so he would take the damage.

      <question>
There’s all these status effect rulings like Razorclaw flipping to bot mode and having his ability carry over to Predaking. This is because Razorclaw isn’t leaving play, he’s just changing modes. Shouldn’t this work similarly with Static Laser of Ironhide? It reads, “When the upgraded character is NOT Ironhide,” but it doesn’t say the character has to be NAMED Ironhide. 
      </question>
      <answer>
On Static Laser of Ironhide, “NOT Ironhide” should also be taken as “NOT named Ironhide”.

      <question>
Since Ironhide and Optimus Prime are both components of Optimus Maximus in Wave 2, how do their unique weapons from Wave 1 interact with the Combiner? Will Optimus Maximus take damage from Static Laser of Ironhide? Can I play Ion Blaster of Optimus Prime on a combined Optimus Maximus?
      </question>
      <answer>
Optimus Maximus would take the damage from Static Laser of Ironhide, as he is not named Ironhide. You can keep Ion Blaster of Optimus Prime if you already had one upgraded to Optimus Prime - Gleaming Commander, but you could not put one onto Optimus Maximus.
