      <question>
    How many damage counters does a character in the KO area have?
</question>
      <answer>
    A KO’d character has damage counters on it equal to its health. Note that this is true even if it took more damage while on the battlefield. For example, if a character with 7 health takes 10 damage, it ends up in the KO area with 7 damage counters. If you return it with I Still Function!, it will end up with 6 damage counters.

      <question>
    What mode is the returned character in?
</question>
      <answer>
    It stays in whatever mode it was KO’d in. If you haven’t already flipped one of your characters, you can flip the returned character to its other mode.

      <question>
Say I have Torox in alt mode and my opponent plays I Still Function! Since ISF repairs 1 damage when it pulls the character from the KO area, and Torox’ alt mode skill shuts down healing, would the character being revived with ISF:
    a) Get brought back, then immediately KO’d due to having damage equal to its health
    b) Not get brought back since ISF would have no effect after the card would be played
    c) Get brought back as normal, ignoring Torox’ skill
        </question>
      <answer>
    The character is brought back and then immediately KO’d as it has an amount of damage equal to its health.

      <question>
In a turn where I play Brainstorm, allowing for 2 more actions. I play I Still Function!, bringing Buzzsaw (Spy) from the KO Area, then I play Recover Cassette, putting Buzzsaw underneath Soundwave. Will that cancel out I Still Function!?
        </question>
      <answer>
Yes, it will. Once Buzzsaw goes underneath Soundwave, all existing and/or pending game effects stop applying to him.

      <question>
Following up on this ruling: 
"Based off the I Still Function! Ruling, would I be able to transform Razorclaw to bot mode, then combine into Predaking but retain his flip ability to attack untapped characters since he's part of the Combiner? 
Yes."
Does this mean that if I flip Rampage into bot-mode and combine into Predaking that turn, will Predaking carry over the ability to repair 1 damage to all my Predacons if Predaking KO's an enemy character?
      </question>
      <answer>
Rampage’s ability has not triggered yet and would not carry over as it does not specify the duration of “this turn” like Razorclaw’s ability does.

      <question>
If I have a tapped character get KO’d that has already attacked, if I play I Still Function!, does he come from the KO pile untapped?
        </question>
      <answer>
Tapped characters get KO’d into the KO Area and are no longer tapped or untapped once in the KO Area. I Still Function! Returns the KO’d character to the Battlefield untapped.

      <question> 
My opponent has Wheeljack untapped and I have Skrapnel untapped. It's my turn and I flip Skrapnel to alt mode, then play I Still Function! to bring back Ransack in bot mode from the KO area. Then I attack with Ransack to Wheeljack, and after the flip of battle cards, Ransack is KO’d. Does Skrapnel’s ability trigger because of Ransack getting KO’d and make Wheeljack tap, letting me attack with Skrapnel?
      </question>
      <answer>
You can do either, but not both. If you want to tap a character using Skrapnel’s flip trigger, you must KO Ransack before he can attack. If you want to attack with Ransack, it will be too late to flip Skrapnel to utilize his flip trigger.

      <question>
If I play I Still Function! and bring a character back from the K.O Area and you have other untapped characters, is the character you returned from the K.O Area required to take its turn first or can you use it after some of your other characters have had their turn? 
      </question>
      <answer>
If you’re attacking with multiple characters, you can attack in any order. I Still Function! doesn’t give you an extra attack by itself.

      <question>
Dreadwind and Blackwing are both in the K.O. Area. If you combine them, Dreadwing would still be K.O.'d. What happens if you play I Still Function! on one of them, then combine them?
      </question>
      <answer>
Dreadwind and Blackwing cannot be combined if they are both in the K.O. Area because their abilities won’t work. If you use I Still Function! to return one of them to the Battlefield, at end of turn, two abilities happen: I Still Function K.O.’s the character and the combining ability of whichever character you brought back happens. If you combine first, then I Still Function! still applies and will K.O. a combined Dreadwing. If I Still Function! K.O.’s the character you brought back first, the combining ability won’t do anything, and you’ll have Dreadwind and Blackwing in K.O. separately. Essentially, you can have Dreadwing in K.O. or Dreadwind and Blackwing in K.O.

If I use I Still Function! to bring back Skywarp - Teleporting Seeker from the KO area, does his ability trigger (assuming he's on his bot mode)?

      <answer>
No. The ability only functions on the battlefield. By the time he's returned to the battlefield, you've already played I Still Function.

How does the new Captain Elita-1 interact with I Still Function!? If my opponent KO’s her during their turn, and I scrap I Still Function as one of the two cards from her trigger, is Elita-1 a valid target for the card?
      </question>
      <answer>
Elita-1 would be a valid target for I Still Function!, but she would still be KO’d at the end of the turn. She would trigger again.

You target Blackwing, bring him back and combine. Now, Blackwing is technically gone right? As Dreadwing is its own bot. But you said I Still Function! KO’s Dreadwing.

As a Combiner, Dreadwing is a mode of Blackwing. Dreadwing is also a mode of Dreadwind.

      <question>
If I start my game with Wave 1 Dinobot Sludge and Wave 2 Grimlock and Dinobot Swoop. After I was able to bring the rest of my Wave 2 Dinobots into the KO area, Grimlock is KO’d and Dinobot Sludge was the only card left on my battlefield in bot mode. On my turn, I played the Dinobot Enigma and then flipped Dinobot Sludge to take all of his damage, was this correct? Also, what if I had played a Brainstorm then an I Still Function! and then a Dinobot Enigma after which I would flip Dinobot Sludge? Is that a better scenario?
      </question>
      <answer>
In your first scenario, Volcanicus appears on the battlefield with 55 damage counters on him. 
In your second scenario, you can I Still Function! one of the five Dinobots and then use the Dinobot Engima to form Volcanicus. Volcanicus will have 54 damage counters on him (because of the 1 damage ISF! repairs). No matter what, he will be KO’d at the end of the turn, so repairing him with Dinobot Sludge probably won’t do a lot.

      <question>
Does the I Still Function! + Dreadwing rule apply generally to Combiners or is it specific to Dreadwing’s method of Combination? Suppose I control Dinobot Sludge - Mighty Stomper and have the five Dinobot components in my KO Area. Can I Brainstorm+ I Still Function! + Dinobot Enigma and expect to keep Volcanicus at the end of the turn?

The same ruling applies. If you I Still Function! One of the Dinobots and then play Dinobot Enigma, at the end of your turn, Volcanicus will be KO’d.

      <question>
Blaster vs. Soundwave. Ravage is in the KO area. Step #1, I play brainstorm. Step #2, I play I Still Function, which brings him back with 1 health. Step #3, I play Recover Cassette, which puts him under Soundwave to heal 2 damage. Now for the question: does I Still Function resolve and Ravage goes back into the KO area? Or does Ravage bypass that effect, thus he is not KO’d?
</question>

Ravage is not KO’d. I Still Function does not find him on the battlefield.

            <question>
                Can you use I Still Function! to combine Skytread?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Yes. Skytread's combine effect is a 'may', which means you can allow one of your Skytread pieces to KO and opt not to combine. On your turn, you can then bring a the Skytread piece back from the KO area using I Still Function!, and then when the returned character KO's at the end of your turn, you would be able to combine to form Raider Skytread. If all characters were tapped, they would have been untapped before the I Still Function! KO, so you would not be able to attack out with the newly combined Raider Skytread.

            <answer>
                
                You can't bring back a Body mode character from KO because it won't have a head. Effects like I Still Function! and Involuntary Promotion will not work at all to bring back a Body. You can, however, bring back a Head from KO because it will be in Bot mode (and only in Bot mode).

          Your Judge must currently be on the battlefield (and not only in your KO area) in order to use Pit of Judgement to return KO’d Sharkticons to the battlefield. If you use I Still Function! or a similar effect to return a KO’d Judge to the battlefield, you may use Pit of Judgement to return a KO’d Sharkticon to the battlefield while the Judge is still on the battlefield. There are currently no methods to add swarm counters to Pit of Judgement beyond the initial starting team composition.
