        <question>
            I play a Decepticon LEADER Body with an Autobot Head. Can I equip Matrix of Leadership to this character? If yes, does the Matrix's 'While on a Leader' ability function?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Card requirements are inclusive, not exclusive. This character fulfills both the AUTOBOT and LEADER requirements on Matrix of Leadership, so you may play the card on the character and the 'While on a Leader" ability will function.

          What happens if my opponent plays a Belligerence, I reveal DaD, and I flip a Matrix of Leadership and Master of Metallikato on defense?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Belligerence would turn this flip of normally [OU, (OUB)] to [OO, (OOB)], meaning that you only flipped 2 colors on defense--Orange and Black, regardless of your characterâ€™s tratis--and would thus get +2 DEF for that battle.

            While in bot mode, Rodimus only gets the bonus once, regardless of how many copies of Matrix of Leadership he is upgraded with.

            The Matrix of Leadership is taken from your deck before you draw your opening hand.  Be sure to shuffle afterwards!
