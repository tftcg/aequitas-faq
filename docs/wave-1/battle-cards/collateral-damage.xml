      <question>
    Who picks their Weapon to scrap first? Who picks a card in their hand to scrap first?
</question>
      <answer>
    Any time both players are given the same instruction, the player whose turn it is goes first. If you play Collateral Damage, first you’ll scrap a Weapon from one of your characters, then your opponent will, then you’ll scrap a card from your hand, and finally your opponent will.

    Yes. You can always play an Action card, even if you can’t carry out some of its instructions. Just do as much as you can.
