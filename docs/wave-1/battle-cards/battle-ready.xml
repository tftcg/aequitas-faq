      <question>
    What happens if I play Battle Ready, and then later in the turn the number of Upgrades on one of my characters changes?
</question>
      <answer>
    The bonus for Battle Ready happens when you play it and wonâ€™t change later in the turn, even if you play an Upgrade or one of your Upgrades is scrapped.
