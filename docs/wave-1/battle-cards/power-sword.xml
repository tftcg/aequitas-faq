      <question>
The enigma cards mention a Combiner keeps an upgrade in each slot, but here's a weird scenario involving that: Say Prowl, Strategic Mastermind is upgraded with a Power Sword. Since he's a melee character, he can obviously take this upgrade. But could you keep that Power Sword on Optimus Maximus when he combines, even though he's a ranged character?

Yes.

      <question>
Apologies if this has been asked before but have a question about type-specific upgrades like Power Sword and Body Armor - These cards specifically requiring Melee characters.
If a character changes type - what happens to the upgrade?
        </question>
      <answer>
Traits, like Melee, are only requirements for upgrades to be attached to a character. Once attached, they stay on when a character flips between alt and bot modes.
