      <question>
    What happens if I somehow play two of these in the same turn?
</question>
      <answer>
    In that case, you’ll take two extra turns after the current turn.

          <tftcg-note>This was later amended with the Extra Turn Rule, defined in this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/transformers-trading-card-game/nagles-notes-once-more-with-feeling/2236280666493746/">article</a> and the Tournament FAQ, that states you can't play more than two turns in a rule under any circumstances. </tftcg-note>

      <question>
I go first and during my first turn I manage to play Peace Through Tyranny (PTT. {I'm sparing the details on how this can be pulled off, but I can go into details if you need me to}), killing off one of my character to grant me an extra turn. Normally on turn 1, that player cannot play a card from their hand and on turn two, the other player gets to play either an Action or an Upgrade. But since I get an extra turn and I am not the other player, on the PTT granted turn (technically the game's and my 2nd turn), do I get to play an Action and Upgrade seeing I'm no longer on my 'first' turn?
        </question>
      <answer>
During turn 1, that player can’t play any cards. During turn 2, the player can play 1 card. From turn 3 onwards, each player can play up to one Action and up to one Upgrade.

      <question>
My opponent just went and used “Peace Through Tyranny” and KO’d his Lionizer...putting it on Spinister. Pteraxadon was already tapped. He then attacked with Spinister and KO’d my Scamper. My Metroplex is still untapped. My opponent has another turn from the PTT. How does that work seeing he’s all tapped out, but I still have a character that’s untapped?
        </question>
      <answer>
Your opponent still takes their extra turn, even if they won’t be able to attack during that turn. They’ll still draw a card and can play cards, etc.

Characters in KO are always fully damaged.

      <question>
Does Peace Through Tyranny do damage to a character when it is K.O.'d or does it just move to the K.O. Area without doing damage? 
      </question>
      <answer>
It K.O.’s the character without damage, but characters in the K.O. Area are assumed to have their maximum damage.

      <question>
Secret Actions say they scrap at the end of my opponent's turn. If I Brainstorm, Secret Action, Peace Through Tyranny, how long does the Secret Action stay out? Will it stay out for my second turn, until it is my opponent's turn, and then scrap at the end of their turn? Or do Secret Actions just scrap at the end of the following turn, so it would scrap at the end of my second turn?
</question>
      <answer>
It will stay out for your second turn and scrap at the end of your opponent's turn.

      <question>
Infiltrate and Peace Through Tyranny - since the ruling was made that one can choose if a Secret Action triggers. Can I wait to see if the person playing PTT KO's one of his characters before deciding to reveal Infiltrate?
</question>
      <answer>
No, you cannot. KO'ing a character is part of Peace Through Tyranny's effect, so it would be too late to reveal your Infiltrate.
Also, it would just be a straight up super not cool thing to do, man.

      <question>
Does Peace Through Tyranny let you go first after everybody untaps? Or does it let you take a second turn right after your current attack skipping the opponents turn?
      </question>
      <answer>
Peace Through Tyranny allows you to have an extra turn after the turn in which you play it. After that turn, it’s your opponent’s turn.

      <question>
My opponent and I both have one tapped bot and one untapped bot in play. It's my turn, and I play Peace Through Tyranny, sacrificing my untapped bot. I now have no untapped bots, and I am the active player. What happens? Am I allowed to continue my current turn, play an upgrade, and flip the tapped bot, and then just skip the combat phase for this turn? What happens on the extra turn granted by Peace Through Tyranny?
      </question>
      <answer>
You can play your upgrades and flip a character, but you would not be able to attack. Same thing applies to the extra turn.

      <question>
For your consideration, Cog. During your opponent's turn, they swing at and KO him. He attaches to one of your characters, leaving you with two. You draw your cards and find that you can attach a Multi-Mission Gear on a Specialist character, which of course you do thanks to his effect. With that Multi-Mission Gear, you decide to be rather aggressive and play a Peace Through Tyranny, KO’ing one of your characters to, and I quote, "take an extra turn after this one". 
Now, in the context that it's currently your opponent's turn, and that you're taking an extra turn after "this one", would that mean that your "extra turn" would actually just be your next regular turn since the "next turn" is just your regular turn or am I mistaken? 
      </question>
      <answer>
If you find a way to play Peace Through Tyranny on your opponent’s turn, you will take the next turn (the “extra turn”), then you’ll take your normal turn, then your opponent will take their turn, and so on.
