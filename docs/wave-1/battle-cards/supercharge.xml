      <question>
When attacking with Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend we know you can't play Supercharge from your attack flip, but what if you play Leap of Faith and scrap Supercharge?
      </question>
      <answer>
You CAN play Supercharge off of OPBL (or via Leap of Faith), but it probably won’t do what you want it to do. It does give Bold 3, but because battle cards have already been flipped for this attack, that Bold 3 won’t do anything. But you could still play it. You know, for fun.
However, if the character you give Bold 3 to gets to attack later in the same turn, that Bold 3 will be in effect.

      <question>
The rules state that when you play an action, you set it off to the side. When Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend plays an action as part of his attack ability, is that card set aside, thus removing the pip from counting attack damage? Example: Prime flips Zap and Supercharge during his attack. He chooses to play Zap. Is his final attack value 9 or 10?
      </question>
      <answer>
The Zap gets set aside, but the orange icon would still increase the attack.

      <question>
Do character abilities still trigger if the requirements are met through cards played but negated by the opponent or otherwise?
For example, Wave 1 Thundercracker’s bot mode ability --&gt; Player 1 uses Supercharge, but player 2 reveals Infiltrate and negates Supercharge. Does Thundercracker's ability still trigger because an action was played? Meaning he would indeed get +1?
</question>
      <answer>
The Infiltrate will scrap the action you played and negate its effect, but Thundercracker’s ability still triggers because you played an action.

      <question>
Character X attacks with Anticipation Engine. They flip Supercharge. Is Bold 3 applied and will they flip 3 extra cards? Bold/Tough are locked in once the first battle flip begins?
</question>
      <answer>
Anticipation Engine’s ability triggers before you flip battle cards, therefore Supercharge will increase your bold.
