        I go first and during my first turn I manage to play Peace Through Tyranny (PTT. {I'm sparing the details on how this can be pulled off, but I can go into details if you need me to}), killing off one of my character to grant me an extra turn. Normally on turn 1, that player cannot play a card from their hand and on turn two, the other player gets to play either an Action or an Upgrade. But since I get an extra turn and I am not the other player, on the PTT granted turn (technically the game's and my 2nd turn), do I get to play an Action and Upgrade seeing I'm no longer on my 'first' turn?

        During turn 1, that player can’t play any cards. During turn 2, the player can play 1 card. From turn 3 onwards, each player can play up to one Action and up to one Upgrade.

        My opponent just went and used “Peace Through Tyranny” and KO’d his Lionizer...putting it on Spinister. Pteraxadon was already tapped. He then attacked with Spinister and KO’d my Scamper. My Metroplex is still untapped. My opponent has another turn from the PTT. How does that work seeing he’s all tapped out, but I still have a character that’s untapped?

        For your consideration, <a href="/wave-3/characters/sergeant-cog-artillery-mechanic.html">Cog</a>. During your opponent's turn, they swing at and KO him. He attaches to one of your characters, leaving you with two. You draw your cards and find that you can attach a <a href="/wave-1/battle-cards/multi-mission-gear.html">Multi-Mission Gear</a> on a Specialist character, which of course you do thanks to his effect. With that Multi-Mission Gear, you decide to be rather aggressive and play a Peace Through Tyranny, KO’ing one of your characters to, and I quote, "take an extra turn after this one". <br/>Now, in the context that it's currently your opponent's turn, and that you're taking an extra turn after "this one", would that mean that your "extra turn" would actually just be your next regular turn since the "next turn" is just your regular turn or am I mistaken?
