      <question>
My opponent has Nightbird in Alt mode with 9 damage counters on her. If I play Plasma Burst to deal the remaining two damage to finish her off, will I still have to deal 1 damage to one of my characters?
        </question>
      <answer>
Yes. Unless the game ends when Nightbird is KOâ€™d.
