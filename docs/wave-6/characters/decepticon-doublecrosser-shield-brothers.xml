        <question>
            Can you have a Doublecrosser in your starting team and a Four The Selectors! and Doublecrosser in your sideboard?
        </question>
        <answer>
            No. The Four The Selectors! stratagem is not in your starting team, therefore Doublecross does not have Horde. However, even if Doublecross did have Horde, Horde only applies to the starting team.
