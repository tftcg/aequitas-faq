        <question>
            Are the cards put under Gnaw face-up or face-down? 
        </question>
        <answer>
            Cards are put under a character face-up unless otherwise specified. If cards are put under a character face-down (such as with Skytread, Sky-Byte, or Perceptor), they are put in a random order so that players do not know which card is which. Once a face-down card is put under a character, players are not permitted to look at them.
