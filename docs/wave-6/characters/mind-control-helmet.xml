        <question>
            Regarding the Stratagem 'Stuck On You'. If I had a normal character and a Titan Master with a Head does that count as two characters or three?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Three characters. Heads are separate characters from their bodies for deck construction, which is what Stuck On You checks. This includes Mind Control Collar and Mind Control Helmet, which are both characters.
