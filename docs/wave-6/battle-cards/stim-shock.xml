        <question>
          What happens to Stim Shock when the Bold has been reduced to zero, for example by Oppress?
        </question>
        <answer>
          If Stim Shock is revealed and an enemy character has had its Bold reduced to 0, it still has Bold. Stim Shock will still do 1 damage to it.
