        <question>
            If you play Private Hot Rod, Decepticon Exhaust, and Out of the Way Hot Rod! and then play Angolmois Surge on Private Hot Rod, can you have Decepticon Exhaust take the 1 point of damage from Angolmois Surge?  If so, is this intended?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Yes you can. The strategem only states 'non-attack damage'. However, this is likely to be changed in an errata to only cover "non-attack damage from an opponent's card".
