          The stat bonuses on Thermal Reciprocation affect all stat boxes in each mode of Autobot Powerglide, Haughty Show-Off. Therefore, with this Stratagem in play, Powerglide in alt mode has 3 Attack and 10 Health, Powerglide in bot mode has 4 Attack and 10 Health, and the S2 Thermal Reciprocator grants +3 Attack to an upgraded character.
