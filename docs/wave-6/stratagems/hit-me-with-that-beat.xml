          Knowing the current amount of damage on Autobot Jazz, Special Ops is important to determine how much damage he takes when his alt mode ability triggers. For example, if he is at full health and an incoming attack triggers his alt mode ability, he first takes 1 point of damage, and then cannot take more than 1 damage for the attack. If he has 4 damage counters, first he takes 1 damage, and then cannot take more than 5 damage for the attack.
