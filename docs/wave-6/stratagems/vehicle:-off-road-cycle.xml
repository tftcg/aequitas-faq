          This Stratagem primarily exists as a teaser for future new mechanics. The Vehicle descriptor does not currently grant any additional abilities beyond what is stated in the reminder text. When this is flipped, return a Sidecar Artillery from your scrap pile to your hand. This can only happen once per game.
