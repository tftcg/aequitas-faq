      <question>
             What are Combiners? 
        </question>
      <answer>
             It would be hard to have a set called Rise of the Combiners without&#x2026; the Combiners!
Combiners are teams of characters that join in a third mode called Combiner mode. Most teams have a corresponding battle card called an Enigma that combines the team under the right circumstances. One Combiner in this set (Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer) has a different way of combining.
When a character is combined, it starts untapped and it gets all the damage counters from the characters that formed it. It can keep upgrades from those characters based on its upgrade slots. Unless the Combiner says differently, it will have 1 Weapon slot, 1 Utility slot, and 1 Armor slot like most characters. If there are too many Upgrades to fit into a slot, you can keep as many as you can fit, and the rest are scrapped.
A character in Combiner mode is a single character, even though it&#x2019;s made up of multiple cards.  When it attacks, the whole thing becomes tapped. If it&#x2019;s KO&#x2019;d (and somehow you haven&#x2019;t lost the game), it stays in Combiner mode in the KO area.
A character in Combiner mode can&#x2019;t flip. Ignore any instruction to flip it. Also, a character in Combiner mode can&#x2019;t &#x201C;break apart&#x201D; into its individual cards.

      <question>
             If I use an Enigma to combine my characters into the Combiner, can I then use the card&#x2019;s first
ability to get its effect?
        </question>
      <answer>
             No. You always follow the instructions on the card in order. If you don&#x2019;t already have the specified Combiner on the battlefield, the first ability won&#x2019;t do anything.

    <entry id="3">
      <question>
             What are Triple Changers?
        </question>
      <answer>
             Triple Changers are characters with three modes: bot mode and two alt modes (labeled 1 and
2). They start in alt mode 1. When a Triple Changer flips, it can flip to either of the two other
modes.
        </answer>

    <entry id="4">
      <question>
             If a card specifically says to flip a Triple Changer to alt mode, what happens?
        </question>
      <answer>
             If it&#x2019;s in bot mode, you can flip it to alt mode 1 or alt mode 2. If it&#x2019;s in one of its alt modes,
you can either not flip it or flip it to the other alt mode.

      <question>
             What is a Green Battle Icon?
        </question>
      <answer>
             This set introduces a new battle icon: green! Here&#x2019;s how it works. After a battle in which you
flipped at least one card with a green battle icon, you may swap a card in your hand with one of
the cards you flipped with a green battle icon. The card you swap from your hand will be
scrapped at the end of the turn, along with all the other cards you played or flipped during the
turn.

             Brave is a new keyword ability that helps some characters protect the rest of their team. When
choosing which enemy to attack, you must choose one with brave if possible.

        </question>
      <answer>
             No, and in fact you can&#x2019;t even if you want to. Brave doesn&#x2019;t override the rules for attacking
tapped/untapped characters. If your opponent has any tapped characters you must attack one
of them. If a tapped character had brave, you would have to attack that one if you could.

    <entry id="11">
      <question>

        </question>
      <answer>
             Stealth is a new keyword ability that lets some characters strike from the shadows without fear
of reprisal. When choosing which enemy to attack, you must attack a character without stealth
if able.

      <question>
             If my opponent has one tapped character with stealth, and the rest of their creatures are
untapped, which character can I attack?
        </question>
      <answer>
             Stealth doesn&#x2019;t override the rules for attacking tapped/untapped characters. Since the
tapped character is the only one that can be attacked, that&#x2019;s where your attack is headed.

      <question>
             What happens if a character has brave and stealth?
        </question>
      <answer>
             Brave and stealth essentially cancel each other out. You must attack that character if able,
and you must attack other characters if able. This basically means you must attack a character
you can attack, the same as if those abilities weren&#x2019;t there.

put up to the specified number of cards from your hand back on top of your deck. If you put
more than one card on top of your deck this way, you can put them there in any order.

    <entry id="122">
      <question>
          What are Secret Actions?
      </question>
      <answer>
Secret Actions are a new kind of Action card, keeping your opponent in the dark until it&#x2019;s too
late for them to stop you. To play a Secret Action, put it into the played area (where actions and
flipped battle cards normally go) face down. Secret Actions don&#x2019;t have an immediate effect, but
wait until later in the game to do their thing, often on your opponent&#x2019;s turn!
Each Secret Action has two parts. First, a Reveal condition. This tells you when to reveal the
Secret Action by turning it face up. Most Reveal conditions are things your opponent does, like
attack one of your characters or play certain kinds of cards.
Second, a When Revealed effect. This tells you what the Secret Action does when it&#x2019;s finally
revealed. After a Secret Action is revealed this way, it stays in the played area and will be
scrapped at the end of the turn.
One warning though: Secret Actions won&#x2019;t wait around forever. If a Secret Action is played
during your turn, it will wait until the end of your opponent&#x2019;s next turn. If its Reveal condition
isn&#x2019;t met by then, it will be scrapped along with all the other played or flipped cards from that
turn. It&#x2019;s scrapped face up, and scrapping it this way won&#x2019;t cause its When Revealed effect to
happen.

Focus is a new keyword. Focus N (where N is a number) means &#x201C;Before flipping battle cards for
this character&#x2019;s battle, look at the top N cards of your deck. You may scrap any of those cards
and put the rest back in any order.&#x201D;
Most often, you&#x2019;ll see focus 1, which means you&#x2019;ll look at the top card of your deck and you
may scrap it.

             If I have a character with focus but another one of my characters is battling, does that focus
ability work?
        </question>
      <answer>
             No. It has to be the character with focus that is battling.

      <question>
             If there&#x2019;s one card left in my deck and a character with Focus 2 is battling, what happens?
        </question>
      <answer>
             You&#x2019;ll set aside at that one card, reshuffle your scrap pile, then set aside the new top card.
Look at those two cards and decide whether to scrap them or put them back on top of your
deck.

      <question>
          What is a Black Battle Icon?
      </question>
      <answer>

There&#x2019;s a new battle icon on some battle cards in War for Cybertron: Siege I. It&#x2019;s black! What
does it mean? If you&#x2019;re on the attack, hopefully good things for you.
For each black battle icon you flip while attacking, your character gets pierce 1 until end of turn.
Remember that pierce numbers add up, so flipping two black icons in an attack will give your
attacker pierce 2, and so on.

        </question>
      <answer>
             No. Black battle icons flipped on defense won&#x2019;t give your character pierce. (And pierce
doesn&#x2019;t work on defense anyway.)
