        <question>
             Can I have more than one of the same character on my team?
        </question>
        <answer>
             You can&#x2019;t have more than one of the same character card on your team, but you can have more than one of the same character if they&#x2019;re on different cards. For example, your team can&#x2019;t have two copies Bumblebee, Brave Warrior, but it could have one Bumblebee, Brave Warrior and one Bumblebee, Courageous Scout.

             Some cards refer to Autobots or Decepticons. How do I know which characters are Autobots?
        </question>
        <answer>
             Autobots have a red frame and the Autobot insignia in the lower right corner. Decepticons have a purple frame and the Decepticon insignia in the lower right corner. A few characters have "Autobot" or "Decepticon" in their names, although these aren&#x2019;t the only Autobots and Decepticons.

             As long as that character is untapped, sure. (The basic rules used with the Autobot Starter Set say that a character can&#x2019;t attack twice in a row, but that rule isn&#x2019;t part of the Advanced Rules.)

        <question>
             How does Pierce work?
        </question>
        <answer>
             Pierce tells you the minimum amount of damage a character can do in an attack, although a character can never do more damage than its attack total. For example, say a character with Pierce 2 attacks.  After flipping battle cards, the attack total is 5 and the defense total is 4. Normally, the character with Pierce would do only 1 damage, but because of Pierce, it does 2 damage instead.  This also works if the attack total is equal to or less than the defense total. Say the attacker has an attack total of 5, but this time it runs into a massive defense total of 9. If that character had Pierce 2, it would still do 2 damage.  If the character with Pierce 2 had an attack total of only 1, it would do 1 damage against any defense total.

        <question>
             Can other effects change the amount of damage done after Pierce is applied?
        </question>
        <answer>
             Yes. For example, say a character with Pierce 4 attacks Insecticon Skrapnel in bot mode. (He has the ability "This can't take more than 3 attack damage from a single attack.") After battle cards are flipped, the attacking character would do 2 damage, but Pierce raises that to 4. Insecticon Skrapnel&#x2019;s ability would then reduce the damage done to 3.

        </question>

             Some Upgrades say "Put on [something] only." How does that work?
        </question>
        <answer>
             These abilities describe what kind of character the Upgrade can be put on. This is usually a trait such
as Melee, Plane, or Insecticon. An Upgrade can be put on a character only if that character matches the
listed requirement.

flip the Plane to its other mode, and it&#x2019;s no longer a Plane. What happens?
        </question>
        <answer>
             The Upgrade stays with the character it&#x2019;s on. That ability limits only what the Upgrade can initially be
put on. Once that happens, the Upgrade doesn&#x2019;t check again.

             If one of my characters is KO&#x2019;d, does it keep its damage counters?
        </question>
        <answer>
             A KO&#x2019;d character has damage counters on it equal to its health. Note that this is true even if it took
more damage while on the battlefield. For example, if a character with 7 health takes 10 damage, it ends
up in the KO area with 7 damage counters.

             Characters don&#x2019;t change modes when are KO&#x2019;d. If a character was in bot mode when it was KO&#x2019;d, it

        <question>
             What is a triggered ability?
        </question>
        <answer>
             A triggered ability is an ability that&#x2019;s caused by a specified game action. They&#x2019;re usually written in the
form "When [something happens] -&gt; [effect]." The effect happens just after the specified game action is
taken. For example, many characters have triggered abilities that start with "When you flip to this
mode." The effects of these abilities happen immediately after you flip the character to the appropriate
mode.

        <question>
             What happens if more than one triggered ability triggers at the same time?
        </question>
        <answer>
             Triggered abilities always happen one at a time. If all the triggered abilities belong to one player, that
player chooses their order. If both players have triggered abilities that would happen at the same time,
first the player whose turn it is handles all their triggered abilities in any order, then the other player
does the same with their triggered abilities.

        What happens if Arcee has a Piercing Blaster or another Upgrade that gives her more Pierce?

      <answer>
        In that case, Arcee will have Pierce equal to her attack plus the Pierce from the Upgrade. In that example, Arcee&#x2019;s attack is 1, so she&#x2019;ll have Pierce 4. However, remember that characters with Pierce 
can&#x2019;t deal more damage than their attack total, so she&#x2019;ll do only 1 damage (not including other attack bonuses or orange battle icons).

    Are the flipped battle cards put into the scrap pile?
</question>
      <answer>
    Not right away. Set them aside for now, in the same place you put played Actions cards and battle cards flipped during the attack. Those cards will all be scrapped at the end of the turn.

    What happens if I put Turbo Booster on a character that&#x2019;s already untapped?

      <answer>
    Nothing much. It will get the +1 attack bonus, but the untap ability won&#x2019;t do anything.
